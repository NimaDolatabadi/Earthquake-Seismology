GENERAL BULLETIN INFORMATION  


The location program currently used for locating earthquakes is
Hypocenter (Lienert et al.,1986). Plane parallel layers are
assumed for local and regional events, while the IASPEI travel
time tables are used for distant events.

The model used for all local and regional events, except for the 
Arctic island  Jan Mayen, is published by Havskov and Bungum (1987). 

 P-wave velocity (km/sec)	depth to top of layer (km)
      6.2 		             0.0
      6.6 		            12.0
      7.1 		            23.0
      8.05		            31.0
      8.25		            50.0
      8.5		            80.0



Magnitudes are calculated from coda duration and/or amplitudes.
The coda wave magnitude is estimated via the formula 
(Engell-Sorensen,personal communication): 

	Mc = -3.0 + 2.6 * log10(T) +0.001 * D.

where T is the coda duration (sec) and D is the epicentral distance (km).  

If instrument corrected maximum ground amplitudes A(nm) are 
available, local magnitude Ml is calculated by the following formula
(Alsaker et al., 1991):  

	Ml= 0.925*log(A) + 0.91*log(D) +0.00087*D -1.31

were D is the hypocentral distance (km).

For the Jan Mayen area a local model is used
(Sornes and Navrestad, 1975): 

  P-wave velocity (km/sec)       depth to layer (km)
    3.14                               0
    6.33                               3
    8.27                              18

The coda magnitude formula for Jan Mayen is given by Westre (1975):

        Mc = -3.24  + 3.27log10(T) + 0.001 * D

All available amplitudes and coda values are used for magnitude 
calculations. No station corrections are used for either travel times or 
magnitudes calculations. The Vp/Vs velocity ratio used in both layered 
models above is 1.73.

As a general policy, neither depths nor epicenters are fixed unless stated 
since this might restrict later use of the data. As a consequence, some event
locations might be unrealistic like zero depth earthquakes around Jan Mayen or
teleseismic locations off by 1000 km. However, the locations are based on the
available data and reflect the location procedure and the models used.

STATIONS USED

The stations listed below are those operated by the Institute of Solid Earth
Physics, University of Bergen (UiB). However, readings from other cooperating
agencies are also used in locating the events and calculating magnitudes and
thus more stations will appear in the event lists than in the station list.
The most common additional readings and magnitudes are received from
NORSAR (Norwegian Seismic Array), and the stations and arrays operated by 
this agency are shown below. Data from NORSAR is included according to the  
following criterias:
Also all NORSAR events recorded by UiB are included. In addition, events 
with magnitude larger than or equal to 2.0 and reported by NORSAR only, are
included.
