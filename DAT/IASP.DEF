This file contain the definitions of phases to be used when calculating
synthetic phases to be plotted with mulplt. There is one phase pr line
and each phase is preceeded with the keyword IASP-PHASE. Only lines with this
keyword will be read. The defined phase then follows in column 13 to 20.
If no phases are defined, all ISPEI91 phases will be used.
