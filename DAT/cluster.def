This file is parameter file for cluster. The file can be in working
directory or DAT.
Only the lines with recognized keywords and a non blank field 
under Par 1 will be read. The comments have no importance. Lines with 
keywords MAGS AFTER DIST TIME and MAGS BEFORE DIST TIME must come grouped 
together in increasing magnitude order. Parameters for these lines are: 
Reference magnitude of main event, maximum magnitude of corresponding after/foreshock (AFTER/FORE), 
distance(km) and time(days).
All number must be real numbers. Columns Par 1-Par 4 start in 
columns 41,51, 61 and 71.
All keywords in capital letters.
Hypocentral distance is calculated as the direct distance between  main shock and dependent event.
Parameter values are interpolated for magnitudes between the ones given.
The values shown in debug output are the interpolated values.
If event is larger than largest event in table, the values for the largest event is used. If event is smaller than smallest event in table, no dependent events will be searched for.

The MAGS AFTER DIST TIME are magnitude of main shock, corresponding magnitude
of largest aftershock, distance and time. Similarly for the foreshocks.

The MAX DEPT DIFFERENCE will consider only events with a depth
difference less than MAX DEPT DIFFERENCE as a possible dependent event.
