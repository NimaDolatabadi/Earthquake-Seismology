#
# corr input file
#
# the program can do 2 things:
#
#    1) find correlated events, in this case comment out
#       parameter SFILE MASTER; program then correlates
#       all events and finds groups, output in file corr.out;
#       this should be done before 2 is attempted in 
#       addition to visual inspection
#
#    2) pick phases in events by correlating with master event,
#       in this case define SFILE MASTER; program uses
#       parts of master event signals and computes correlation
#       for the remaining events; phase output is written to corr.out
#
#  trace file corr.trace gives additional info on the program run
