# Steps to add an external command to libext.so, 
# a shared external command library, under Solaris.  
#
# 1) compile/load srcs into one or more external libs.  
cc -o libext.so -G flipxy.c  # note: can have multiple srcs on this line
# Note that libext.so is the shared library and flipxy is the 
# command to be loaded.  By default it will be called flipxy.  
# See the load command for more details.  
# I think multiple commands can be loaded at once as follows
# cc -o libext.so -G extern.c velarr.c flipxy.c 
#
# 2) setup the SACSOLIST and LD_LIBRARY_PATH environments. 
#    Not from this script but in login since these only are set temporarily.  
# setenv SACSOLIST libext.so   # Use space delim and quotes for multiple libs
# setenv LD_LIBRARY_PATH ${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}:/us/peterg/res1/sac/bin/external 
# 
# 3) Optional:  Use init script to load automatically. 
# alias sac "/usr/local/bin/sac /us/peterg/bin/sacmac/sac.init" 
# where sac.init includes the command load command_name
#
# 4) Startup sac and load the command 
# E.g.,  SAC> load flipxy  (may be unnecessary if loaded in sac.init.  
# Run the command as designed.  
# 
###  How to pass this out.  ###
#  a) Give the users the function and this notes file.  
#  b) Give out the libext.so and tell users to do steps 2-4.
