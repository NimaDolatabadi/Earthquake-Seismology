DESCRIPTION
-----------
   Many of the newer graphics terminals and workstations support the
   concept of multiple "windows".  Different jobs or activities can run in each
   window and display their results on the screen at the same time.  "X-windows"
   and "Sun windows" are two of the more popular systems currently available.
   If you are using a device that supports one of these systems, then you can
   use multiple graphics windows in SAC to display your results.  If you are not
   using such a device, SAC will accept but ignore all commands that refer to
   multiple graphics windows.
   There are two commands that control the use of this multi-windowing
   option.  The WINDOW_ command lets you control the location and shape of the
   graphics windows.  The BEGINWINDOW_ command lets you select the window in which
   to display subsequent plots.  BEGINWINDOW_ will create the requested window if
   it does not currently exist on your display.  The WINDOW_ command only works
   BEFORE the window is created.  On most systems you can also move and resize
   these windows dynamically using the mouse and pop-up menus.  Generally but not
   always (you should check for yourself), the moving of a window will result in
   the current plot being automatically redrawn whereas the resizing of a window
   results in the current plot being redrawn but not rescaled.  The next plot in
   a resized window will be scaled correctly.  All text (the commands you type
   and SAC's responses) are displayed in the window in which you started SAC.
