SUMMARY
-------
Opens a alphanumeric pick file.

SYNTAX
------

  ``OAPF {STANDARD|NAME},{file}``

INPUT
-----
   :STANDARD:  Use the standard file id when writing picks.  The standard
       id consists of the event name, the station name, and the component
       azimuth and incident angles from the SAC header.
    
   :NAME:  Use the name of the SAC data file instead of the standard id.
    
   :file:  The name of the alphanumeric pick file to open.  If a file by
       that name already exists, it is opened and new picks are added at
       the bottom.
    
DEFAULT VALUES
--------------

  ``OAPF STANDARD APF``

DESCRIPTION
-----------
  The alphanumeric pick file can be used like a simple data base for picks
  produced by the automatic picker (APK) and manual pick plot (PLOTPK) command.
  One line is written for each pick.  Each normal line in one of these files
  consists of the file id, the pick id, the time of the pick, the amplitude of
  the pick, and some formatting information.  These lines are 80 characters 
  long. The file id is the standard one consisting of selected fields from the
  header as mentioned above or the name of file.  The time of the pick is either
  the GMT time or the offset time.  This depends upon the options specified in
  the commands generating the pick, such as APK_ or PLOTPK_.  This leads to four
  distinct formats, designated by a different character in column 79.  Some
  lines, such as those from waveform and peak-to-peak picks, contain additional
  fields after column 80.  The maximum length of a line is 200 characters.  The
  specific formats of these various lines are shown in the tables on the
  following pages.

ERROR MESSAGES
--------------
- 1903: Can't close previous card image pick file.
- 1902: Can't open card image pick file

  - Probably an illegal character in filename.
