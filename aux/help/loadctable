++++++++++

SUMMARY
-------
Allows the user to select a new color table for use in image plots.

SYNTAX
------

  ``LOADCTABLE n | [options] [filelist]``
   where n is a number (currently between 1 and 17) of a standard SAC

  ``color table stored in directory SACAUX, or``
   where options is the following:


  ``DIR CURRENT|name``


  ``options MUST preceed any element in the filelist.``

INPUT
-----
   :n:  The number of a standard SAC color table.
    
   :DIR CURRENT:  Load color table from the current directory.  This is
       the directory from which you started SAC.
    
   :DIR name:  Load color table from the directory called name.  This may
       be a relative or absolute directory name.
    
   :filelist:  file
    
   :file:  A legal color table filename.  This may be a simple filename or
       a pathname.  The pathname can be a relative or absolute one.
    
DESCRIPTION
-----------
   This command allows the user to select a new color table or provide their own
   custom color table by specifying the color table file with a pathname,
   relative to the current directory. If the DIR option is not used, SAC looks first in
   SACAUX for the color table, then in the user's working directory.
