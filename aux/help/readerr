DESCRIPTION
-----------
   Several errors can occur when you try to read a data file into memory
   using the READ_ command.  The file may not exist or it may exist but can't be
   read.  When SAC encounters one of these bad files, it normally sends a warning
   message and then tries to read the rest of the files in the filelist.  If you
   want SAC to stop reading in files whenever a bad file is encountered set the
   BADFILE condition to FATAL.  If you don't even want to see the warning
   message, set the BADFILE condition to IGNORE.
   If none of the files in the filelist could be read, SAC normally sends
   an error message and stops processing.  If you want SAC to send a warning
   message or ignore this problem completely, set the NOFILES condition
   accordingly.  Also, any files previously in memory can be deleted (removed
   from) or remain in memory by using the MEMORY DELETE or MEMORY SAVE options.
   The CUTERR_ command can be used to control certain errors that occur due
   to bad cut parameters.
