SUMMARY
-------
Controls the tracing of blackboard and header variables.

SYNTAX
------

  ``TRACE [ON|OFF] name [name ...]``

INPUT
-----
   :ON:  Turn tracing on for variables that follow.
    
   :OFF:  Turn tracing off for variables that follow.
    
   :name:  The name of the blackboard or header variable to trace.  If
   :this is a header variable it is of the form: filename,hdrname ,BREAK
       where filename is the name (or number) of the SAC data file and
       hdrname is the name of a SAC header variable.
    
DEFAULT VALUES
--------------

  ``TRACE ON``

DESCRIPTION
-----------
  This command can be used to trace or track the values of SAC blackboard or
  header variables while SAC is executing.  It is useful primarily for debugging
  long or complicated macros.  When the tracing for a variable is turned on, its
  current value is printed.  While the tracing is on, its value is checked after
  the execution of each command.  Each time its value changes a new output line
  is printed.  When tracing is turned off, its current value is also printed.

EXAMPLES
--------
  To turn tracing on for the blackboard variable called TEMP1 and for the
  header variable called T0 belonging to the file called MYFILE::

      u:  TRACE ON TEMP1 MYFILE,T0
      s:  TRACE  (on) TEMP1 = 1.45623
      s:  TRACE  (on) MYFILE,T0 = UNDEFINED

  As you execute commands, either typed at the terminal or executed from a
  macro, SAC will check the values of the variables versus the saved value and
  print a message whenever either one of them changes.  Assume that some
  calculations are performed that caused TEMP1 to change and  T0 to become
  defined.  SAC would print the messages::

      s:  TRACE (mod) TEMP1 = 2.34293
      s:  TRACE (mod) MYFILE,T0 = 10.3451

  Later in the processing TEMP1 may change again::

      s:  TRACE (mod) TEMP1 = 1.93242

  When the tracing is turned off, SAC will print the current value one last
  time::

      u:  TRACE OFF TEMP1 MYFILE,T0
      s:  TRACE (off) TEMP1 = 1.93242
      s:  TRACE (off) MYFILE,T0 = 10.3451
