  ``BORDER OFF``

DESCRIPTION
-----------
   When this option is on, a solid border is drawn around the sides of the plot
   at the edge of the viewport (see XVPORT.) Note that an axis line is always
   drawn on each side of the plot that contains an annotated axis (see AXES) or
   a set of tick marks (see TICKS).  Thus the border option only applies to those
   sides without axes or tick marks.
