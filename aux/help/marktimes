MARKTIMES
+++++++++

SUMMARY
-------
Marks files with travel times from a velocity set.

SYNTAX
------

  ``MARKTIMES {TO marker},{DISTANCE HEADER|v},``

  ``{ORIGIN HEADER|v|GMT time},{VELOCITIES v ...}``

INPUT
-----
   :TO marker:  Define the first time marker in the header to store
       results.  The time markers are incremented for each requested
       velocity.
    
   :marker:  T0|T1|T2|T3|T4|T5|T6|T7|T8|T9
    
   :DISTANCE HEADER:  Use the distance (DIST) from the header in the
       travel time calculations.
    
   :DISTANCE v:  Use v as the distance in the travel time calculations.
    
   :ORIGIN HEADER:  Use the origin time (O) in the header in the travel
       time calculations.
    
   :ORIGIN v:  Use v as the offset origin time.
    
   :ORIGIN GMT time:  Use the Greenwich mean time time as the origin time.
    
    
   :time:  Greenwich mean time in the form of six integers: year, julian
       day, hour, minute, second, and millisecond.
    
   :VELOCITIES v ...:  Set the velocity set to use in the travel time
       calculations.  Up to 10 velocities may be entered.
    
ALTERNATE FORMS
---------------
UTC for Universal Time Coordinate may be used instead of GMT.

DEFAULT VALUES
--------------

  ``MARKTIMES VELOCITIES 2. 3. 4. 5. 6.  DISTANCE HEADER ORIGIN HEADER TO T0``

DESCRIPTION
-----------
  This command marks travel travel times in the header, given the origin time
  of the event, the epicentral distance, and an input velocity set.  The
  following simple equation is used to estimate travel times.::

     time(j) = origin + distance/velocity(j)

  The results are written into the header in the requested time marker.

EXAMPLES
--------
  To use the default velocity set but force the distance to be 340 kilometers
  and the first marker to be T4::

      u:  MARKTIMES DISTANCE 340. TO T4

  To select a different velocity set::

      u:  MARKT V 3.5 4.0 4.5 5.0 5.5

  To set the origin time in GMT and store the results in T2::

      u: MARKT ORIGIN GMT 1984 231 12 43 17 237 TO T2
