READSP
++++++

SUMMARY
-------
Reads spectral files written by WRITESP_ and WRITESPE.

SYNTAX
------

  ``READSP {AMPH|RLIM|SPE} {filelist}``

INPUT
-----
   :RLIM:  Read real and imaginary components.
    
   :AMPH:  Read amplitude and phase components.
    
   :SPE:  Read spectral estimation subprocess files.  The data is
       converted from power to amplitude.  The phase component is set to
       zeros.
    
   :filelist:  A list of SAC binary data files.  This list may contain
       simple filenames, full or relative pathnames, and wildcard
       characters.  See the READ_ command for a complete description.
    
DEFAULT VALUES
--------------

  ``READSP AMPH``

DESCRIPTION
-----------
   The WRITESP_ command writes each spectral data component to disk as a separate
   file.  You may then process each component separately.  This command lets you
   reconstruct the spectral data from the two components.  See the WRITESP_
   documentation for more details.  The SPE_ option allows you to read in and
   convert to spectral format, files that were written using the WRITESPE
   command in the Spectral Estimation Subprocess. This allows you to use
   commands such as MULOMEGA_ and DIVOMEGA_ on these spectral estimates.

   Any command which loads data into memory is monitored to maintain a
   level of confidence in the event infomation when transfered from the SAC
   data buffer to the CSS data buffer.  When READSP_ is used, the confidence
   is set to LOW, indicating that SAC should consider any matching event IDs
   as artifacts and reassign the event ID of the incoming file.  For more
   details, use HELP_ READ_.
