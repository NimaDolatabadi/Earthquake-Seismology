SAVEIMG
+++++++

SUMMARY
-------
Saves a display graphics window to an image file in a variety of formats

SYNTAX
------

  ``[SAVE]IMG filename.format``

INPUT
-----
   :filename:  Filename for the saved image.  
   
   :format: Format for saved file from among one of the four choices:
       ps  (Postscript);
       pdf (Portable Document Format);
       png (Image file)
       xpm (Pixmap format)
        
    
DESCRIPTION
-----------
  This command will save a current plot to an image file format including
  Postscript (ps), Portable Document Format (pdf), Image file (png), and 
  Pixmap file (xpm).  The format is derived from the filename's extension.
  
  An advantage of SAVEIMG to producing SGF_ files is that letters and numbers 
  in .sgf files are made up of drawn line segments, while those in the .ps
  or .pdf images produced by SAVEIMG use the Postscript feature of producing
  fonts directly.  Also, for many applications, a lower-resolution .png or
  ,xpn file is sufficient.  Because of potential problems with portability,
  the PNG format is not enabled in the default builds of SAC.
  
  The .xpm and .png files will have the aspect ratio of the current window.
  (See WINDOW_ for instructions about choosing the size and aspect ratio of
  display windows.)  The .pdf and .ps files produced by SAVEIMG will have a
  fixed aspect ratio of X/Y = 11/8.5 = 1,2941.  For these plots, the plots will
  look best if the display window  aspect ratio is 1.2941.
  
  As with .sgf files, the plots will not have a tight boundingbox.  For .sgf
  files the script SACDIR/bin/sgftoeps.csh will produce an EPS file with a
  tight boundingbox if the program Ghsostscript (gs) is in the path.  Similar
  scripts could be written for the output files from SAVEIMG.

  To save a plot using SAVEIMG, the plot must already be visible.  SAVEIMG will 
  not work in the SSS subprocess, but if one enters qs after creating the plot,
  SAVEIMG can then be used for that image.  Also, if a frame has been opened to
  produce multiple panels in a single file, saveimg cannot be used until after
  the ENDFRAME_ command.
  
EXAMPLES
--------
  To save a file as a PDF document::

       SAC> read PAS.CI.BHZ.sac
       SAC> p1
       SAC> saveimg pas.ci.pdf

  To save a spectrogram in three different formats::

       SAC> fg seismo
       SAC> spectrogram
       SAC> save spectrogram.ps
       SAC> save spectrogram.xpm
       SAC> save spectrogram.pdf
