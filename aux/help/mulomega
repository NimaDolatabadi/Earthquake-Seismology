MULOMEGA
++++++++

SUMMARY
-------
Performs differentiation in the frequency domain.

DESCRIPTION
-----------
  This command multiplies each point of a spectral file by its frequency given
  by::

    OMEGA = 2.0 * PI * FREQ

  This is analogous to differentiating the equivalent time series file.  The
  spectral file can in either amplitude-phase or real-imaginary format.
