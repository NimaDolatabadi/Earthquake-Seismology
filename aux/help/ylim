YLIM
++++

SUMMARY
-------
Determines the plot limits for the y axis.

SYNTAX
------

  ``YLIM {ON|OFF|ALL|min max|PM v ....}``

INPUT
-----
   :{ON}:  Turn y limits option on, but don't change limits.
    
   :OFF:  Turn y limits option off.
    
   :ALL:  Scale y limits to the minimum and maximum of all files in
       memory.
    
   :min max:  Turn fixed y option on and change limits to min and max.
    
   :PM v:  Turn fixed y option on and change limits to minus and plus the
       absolute value of v.  ,SKIP You may define different y limit
       options for each file in memory if you wish.  The first entry in the
       command applies to the first file in memory, the second entry to
       the second file, etc.  The last entry applies to the remainder of
       the files in memory.
    
DEFAULT VALUES
--------------

  ``YLIM OFF``

DESCRIPTION
-----------
   When this option is on, fixed limits are used in plotting.  When off, the
   limits are scaled to the data.  The limits can also be scaled to the entire
   data set if desired.  Different values may be set for each file in memory.

EXAMPLES
--------
  Consider the following set of commands::

      u:  YLIM 0.0 30.0 ALL OFF
      u:  READ FILE1 FILE2 FILE3
      u:  PLOT

  FILE1 would be plotted with y limits of 0.0 and 30.  FILE2 would be scaled to
  the minimum and maximum values of all files in memory.  FILE3 would be scaled
  to its own minimum and maximum values.  If more than three files were read in,
  they would also be scaled to their own minimum and maximum values.
