DATAGEN
+++++++

SUMMARY
-------
Generates sample data files and stores them in memory.

SYNTAX
------

  ``DATAGEN {MORE} {COMMIT|ROLLBACK|RECALLTRACE} {SUB name} {filelist}``

   where name is one of the following:

  ``LOCAL``

  ``REGIONAL``

  ``TELESEISEM``


INPUT
-----
   :MORE:  Place the new sample data files in memory AFTER the old data.
       If this option is omitted, the new sample data files REPLACE the
       old ones.
    
   :Note:  if the MORE option is not specified, the COMMIT_, ROLLBACK_,
       and RECALLTRACE_ options have no effect.
    
   :COMMIT:  If the MORE option is specified, the COMMIT option commits
       headers and waveforms in SAC memory -- removing any previous
       versions of headers or waveforms from RAM -- prior to
       generating more files.  COMMIT is the default.
    
   :ROLLBACK:  If the MORE option is specified, the ROLLBACK option reverts
       to the last committed version of the header and waveform
       before generating more files.
    
   :RECALLTRACE:  If the MORE option is specified, the RECALLTRACE option:

      - reverts to the last committed version of the waveform,
      - reverts to the last committed version of those header
      	variables closely linked to the waveform,
      - commits those header variables which are loosely linked
       	to the waveform.
       	(use HELP_ RECALLTRACE for a list of which header variables are
       	committed, and which are rolled back.)
    
   :SUB name: Select the sub-directory name from which to read the data.
       Where the subdirectory name is local, regional, or teleseismic.
    
       A filelist is required. Possible filenames are listed below.
    
   :name:  LOCAL|REGIONAL|TELESEIS ,BREAK Specifics about the contents of
       these sub-directories is given below.
    
   :filelist:  A list of SAC sample data files.  The names of the files in
       each subdirectory are given below.  This list may contain simple
       filenames and wildcard characters.  See the READ_ and WILD_ commands
       for a complete description.

  ``DATAGEN COMMIT SUB LOCAL cdv.z``

DESCRIPTION
-----------
  This command reads one or more files from a set of sample seismograms
  provided with the program.  In fact, it operates much like the READ_ command
  except that it gets the data from a special data directory.  You specify the
  name of the sub-directory containing the event of interest.  Each
  sub-directory contains a different type of event.  You can use wildcards just
  like the READ_ command to specify groups of files in the sub-directory.


ERROR MESSAGES
--------------
- 1301: No data files read in.

  - haven't given a list of files to read.  
  - none of the files in the list could be read.

- 1314: Data file list can't begin with a number.
- 1315: Maximum number of files in data file list is


WARNING MESSAGES
----------------
- 0101: opening file
- 0108: File does not exist:
- 0114: reading file

  - Normally when SAC encounters one of these errors it skips that file and
    reads the remainder.  These errors can be made to be fatal using 
    the READERR_ command.


LOCAL EVENT
-----------
  The local event occurred in the Livermore Valley of California.
  It was a small unfelt event (ML 1.6).  It was recorded by the Livermore Local
  Seismic Network (LLSN).  LLSN is a set of vertical and three-component
  stations operated by LLNL and the USGS.  Data from nine three-component
  stations are included in this set.  There is 40 seconds of data sampled at 100
  samples per second.  Station information, event information, p-wave 
  time picks, and coda picks are included in the headers.  The filenames are::

    cal.z, cal.n, cal.e
    cao.z, cao.n, cao.e
    cda.z, cda.n, cda.e
    cdv.z, cdv.n, cdv.e
    cmn.z, cmn.n, cmn.e
    cps.z, cps.n, cps.e
    cva.z, cva.n, cva.e
    cvl.z, cvl.n, cvl.e
    cvy.z, cvy.n, cvy.e

REGIONAL EVENT
--------------
  The regional event occurred in Nevada and was recorded by the
  Digital Seismic Network (DSS).  DSS is a set of four broadband
  three-component stations in the Western U.S.  The stations are:

   :elk: Elko, NV

   :lac: Landers, CA

   :knb: Kanab, UT

   :mnv: Mina, NV

  The sampling rate is 40 samples per second. The files contain 300 seconds of
  data, starting 5 seconds before the origin time of the event.  The filenames
  are::

    elk.z, elk.n, elk.e
    lac.z, lac.n, lac.e
    knb.z, knb.n, knb.e
    mnv.z, mnv.n, mnv.e


TELESEISMIC EVENT
-----------------
  The teleseismic event occurred off the coast of Northern
  California near Eureka on September 10, 1984.  It was a moderate to large
  event (ML 6.6, MB 6.1, MS 6.7) and was felt from the San Francisco Bay area
  to Roseburg, Oregon.  It was recorded at the Regional Seismic Test Network
  (RSTN), a set of five stations in the U.S. and Canada.  The stations are:

    :cpk: Tennessee

    :ntk: Northwest Territories, Canada

    :nyk: New York

    :onk: Ontario, Canada

    :sdk: South Dakota

  Both mid-period and long period data is included.  Data from cpk was not
  available and the long-period data from sdk is clipped.  There is 1600 seconds
  of data in this set.  The long-period data was recorded at 1 sample per second
  and the mid-period data at 4 samples per second.  The filenames are::
  
    ntkl.z, ntkl.n, ntkl.e, ntkm.z, ntkm.n, ntkm.e
    nykl.z, nykl.n, nykl.e, nykm.z, nykm.n, nykm.e
    onkl.z, onkl.n, onkl.e, onkm.z, onkm.n, onkm.e
    sdkl.z, sdkl.n, sdkl.e, sdkm.z, sdkm.n, sdkm.e
