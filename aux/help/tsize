TSIZE
+++++

SUMMARY
-------
Controls the text size attributes.

SYNTAX
------

  ``TSIZE {size v},{RATIO v},{OLD|NEW}``
   where size is one of the following:

  ``TINY|SMALL|MEDIUM|LARGE``

INPUT
-----
   :size v:  Change the value of one of the text sizes to v.
    
   :RATIO v:  Change the text width to height ratio to v.
    
   :OLD:  Change the values of all the text sizes to their "old" values.
       These are the values used by SAC prior to Version 9.
    
   :NEW:  Change the values of all the text sizes to their "new" values.
       These are the default values when SAC is initialized.
    
DEFAULT VALUES
--------------

  ``TSIZE RATIO 1.0 NEW``

DESCRIPTION
-----------
  Most of the text annotation commands (TITLE, XLABEL_, FILEID_, etc.)
  allow you to change the size of the text being displayed.  You may choose from
  a set of four named sizes (TINY, SMALL, MEDIUM, and LARGE.) Each named size
  has an initial value given in the table below.  These sizes are the height of
  a character as a fraction of the full (0.0 to 1.0) viewspace.  There are times
  when you may want some of this annotation to be of a size different from
  these default values.  TSIZE_ allows you to redefine any or all of these four
  named sizes.  You may also use this command to change the width to height
  ratio of the characters.

  The default text sizes were changed, starting with Version 9 of SAC.
  The new set covers a wider range and generally looks better on most devices.
  You can easily change back to the original set of sizes by using the OLD
  option.  This might be useful if you want to create a plot that looks very
  similar to one that was generated using an older version of SAC.  Also old
  PLOTC_ files and macros will not look the same when replotted unless you first
  set the text sizes to their old values.  The NEW option resets the sizes to
  their default values.

  DEFAULT TEXT SIZES

   ======= ====== === === === ====
   NAME    A      B   C   D   E
   ======= ====== === === === ====
   TINY    0.015  66  50  68  110
   SMALL   0.020  50  37  66  82
   MEDIUM  0.030  33  25  44  55
   LARGE   0.040  25  18  33  41
   ======= ====== === === === ====

   The column definitions in the table above are as follows:

    - A Height of character as a fraction of full viewspace.
    - B Number of lines of text in full viewspace.
    - C Number of lines of text in a normal viewspace.
        Normal means 0. to 1. in x and 0. to 0.75 in y.
    - D Minimum number of characters per normal viewspace line.
    - E Average number of characters per normal viewspace line.
        This is larger because the text is proportionally spaced.

EXAMPLES
--------
  To change the definition of MEDIUM and then use it to create a specially
  sized title::

      u:  TSIZE MEDIUM 0.35
      u:  TITLE 'Rayleigh Wave Spectra' SIZE MEDIUM
      u:  PLOT2

  To reset this (and any other) size definitions to their default values::

      u:  TSIZE NEW
