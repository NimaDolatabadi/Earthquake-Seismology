XFUDGE
++++++

SUMMARY
-------
Changes the x axis "fudge factor."

SYNTAX
------

  ``XFUDGE {ON|OFF|v}``

INPUT
-----
   :{ON}:  Turn fudge option on but don't change fudge factor.
    
   :OFF:  Turn fudge option off.
    
   :v:  Turn fudge option on and change fudge factor to v.
    
DEFAULT VALUES
--------------

  ``XFUDGE 0.03``

DESCRIPTION
-----------
  When this option is on, the actual axis limits are changed by a "fudge
  factor".  The algorithm for a linearly interpolated axis is::

    XDIFF=XFUDGE*(XMAX-XMIN)
    XMIN=XMIN-XDIFF
    XMAX=XMAX+XDIFF

  where XMIN and XMAX are the data extrema and XFUDGE_ is the fudge factor.  The
  algorithm is similiar for logarithmically interpolated axes.  The fudge option
  only applies when the axis limits are scaled to the data extrema (see XLIM.)
