DECIMATE
++++++++

SUMMARY
-------
Decimates (downsamples) data, including an optional anti-aliasing FIR_ filter.

SYNTAX
------

  ``DECIMATE {n},{FILTER {ON|OFF}}``

INPUT
-----
   :n:  Set decimation factor to n.  Range is 2 to 7.  This command may be
       applied several times if a larger decimation factor is required.
    
   :FILTER {ON}:  Turn anti-aliasing FIR_ filter on.
    
   :FILTER OFF:  Turn anti-aliasing FIR_ filter off.
    
DEFAULT VALUES
--------------

  ``DECIMATE 2 filter on``

DESCRIPTION
-----------
  This command is used to downsample data after it has been read into memory.
  An optional finite impulse response (FIR) filter is applied to the data as 
  it is being decimated to prevent aliasing effects normally associated with 
  downsampling digitized analog signals.  These filters also preserve the 
  phase information.  The application of these FIR_ filters often produces 
  undesirable transients at each end of the data so the results should be 
  checked graphically.  Turning the anti-aliasing filter option off should 
  only be done when the accuracy of the high frequency response is 
  unimportant, such as when plotting.

EXAMPLES
--------
  To reduce the sampling rate by a factor of 42::

      u:  READ FILE1
      u:  DECIMATE 7
      u:  DECIMATE 6

ERROR MESSAGES
--------------
- 1003: Value out of allowed range at symbol

  - Range on decimation factor is 2 to 7.

- 1301: No data files read in.
- 1306: Illegal operation on unevenly spaced file
- 1307: Illegal operation on spectral file

**Note** The decimation by 7 filter has occasionally been unstable.
