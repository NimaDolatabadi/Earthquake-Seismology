SYNTAX
------

  ``QDP {ON|OFF|n},{TERM ON|OFF|n},{SGF ON|OFF|n}``

INPUT
-----
   :ON:  Turn QDP_ option on for both the terminal and SAC Graphics File
       (SGF) devices.
    
   :OFF:  Turn QDP_ option off for both devices.
    
   :n:  Turn QDP_ option on for both devices and change the approximate
       number of data points to plot to n.
    
   :TERM ON:  Turn quick and dirty plotting on for the terminal.
    
   :TERM OFF:  Turn quick and dirty plotting off for the terminal.
    
   :TERM n:  Turn QDP_ option on for the terminal and change the
       approximate number of data points to plot to n.
    
   :SGF ON:  Turn quick and dirty plotting on for the SGF_.
    
   :SGF OFF:  Turn quick and dirty plotting off for the SGF_.
    
   :SGF n:  Turn QDP_ option on for the SGF_ and change the approximate
       number of data points to plot to n.

DESCRIPTION
-----------
  Plotting large files (greater than say 1000 points) can take a long
  time.  The "quick and dirty plot" option speeds up plotting by NOT plotting
  each data point.  When this option is on, SAC will compute a section size by
  dividing the number of data points in the file by the number of data points
  you want displayed.  The larger the file, the more data points in each 
  section.

  SAC then computes and displays only the minimum and the maximum data point in
  each section.  SAC displays a "desampling factor" (half the section size) in a
  small box in the corner of the plot when this option is on.  Displayed data
  points may be somewhat closer or further apart than this number indicates
  since the extremum in each region are being plotted.

  There is a separate QDP_ option for the terminal and the SAC Graphics
  File device.  The terminal QDP_ factor also applies to the XWINDOWS and
  SUNWINDOWS graphics devices.  By default the QDP_ factor is considerably
  smaller for the terminal than for the SGF_.  This allows for very fast plots
  to the terminal and a more representative plot to the SGF_.  If both devices
  are on at the same time, the terminal QDP_ option applies.  You may turn 
  either of these options off or change the number of displayed points.

EXAMPLES
--------
  Assume FILE1 has 2100 data points and FILE2 has 4700 data points.  If you
  typed::

      u:  READ FILE1 FILE2
      u:  BEGINDEVICES TERMINAL
      u:  PLOT

  both plots would contain approximately 200 data points.  The plot of FILE1
  would contain approximately every tenth data point and the plot of FILE2
  every twenty-third data point.  The section size is rounded down to ensure
  that you will see at least the number of requested data points.  If you now
  plotted those same files to the SGF::

      u:  BEGINDEVICES SGF
      u:  PLOT

  both plots would contain approximately 1000 data points.  If both devices were
  on, the plots would contain approximately 200 data points, the factor for the
  terminal.
