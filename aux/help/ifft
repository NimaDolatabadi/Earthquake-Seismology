IFFT
++++

SUMMARY
-------
Performs an inverse discrete Fourier transform.

SYNTAX
------

  ``IFFT``

ALTERNATE FORMS
---------------
  Purists may use IDFT instead of IFFT_.

DESCRIPTION
-----------
  Data files must have been previously transformed using the FFT_ command.  They
  may be in either real-imaginary or amplitude-phase format.

HEADER CHANGES
--------------
  B, DELTA, and NPTS are changed to the beginning frequency, sampling
  frequency, and number of data points in the transform.  The original values of
  B, DELTA, and NPTS are saved in the header as SB, SDELTA, and NSNPTS and are
  restored when this command performed.

ERROR MESSAGES
--------------
- 1301: No data files read in.
- 1305: Illegal operation on time series file
- 1606: Maximum allowable DFT is


LIMITATIONS
-----------
  The maximum inverse transform that can currently be performed is 65536 points.
