PICKAUTHOR
++++++++++

SUMMARY
-------
Tell sac to read author list (and possibly phase pick information) from
a user-defined preferences file, or interactively enter author list on
the PICKAUTHOR_ command line.

SYNTAX
------

  ``PICKAUTHOR author1 {author2 author3 ... }``

  ``PICKAUTHOR FILE {filename}``

  ``PICKAUTHOR PHASE {filename}``

INPUT
-----
   :authorlist:     sac uses the input to create the author list.
    
   :FILE:	if the FILE option is used, sac will read the author list
       from the preferences file.  If a filename is given on the
       command line, sac will read the specified file, else it will
       read the most recently entered file name from a previous
       call to PICKAUTHOR_.  If no filename was ever entered, sac
       will look for SACAUX/csspickprefs.
    
   :PHASE:	this option behaves essencially like the FILE option with
       the added benefit of having sac read specific header
       variable information as well.

  ``PICKAUTHOR FILE``


DESCRIPTION
-----------
  PICKAUTHOR_ is provided as a means to override the preferences file on the
  command line.  It can be used to provide a prioritized list of authors at
  the command line, or to redirect SAC from one preferences file to
  another.  For more on the preferences files, see PICKPREFS_ and READCSS_.

  Note:  If the user alters the preference settings while data is in the data
  buffers, the picks in the SAC data buffer (the buffer visible to the user
  through LISTHDR_ and CHNHDR_ etc.) may be modified.
  Eg. if the author list is "john rachel michael" and some files are read
  with the READCSS_ command some arrivals may be read with author = michael.  
  (The user will proably not be aware of who the author is for a given pick, 
  because the author field in CSS does not appear in the SAC format.)  If 
  the user later uses the PICKAUTHOR_ command to change the author list 
  to "peter doug rachel", then on a READCSS_ MORE command, no arrivals 
  with author = michael will be read from the data files, and the file 
  already in memory will lose the picks which have michael as the author.  
  The user may not know why seemingly random picks have disappeard.  
  For an explanation, type HELP_ PICKPREFS_.
