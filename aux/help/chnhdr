CHNHDR
++++++

SUMMARY
-------
Changes the values of selected header fields.

SYNTAX
------

  ``CHNHDR  { file n1 n2 ... } field v  {field v ... }``

INPUT
-----
   :file:  This is an optional keyword that can be followed by
       a list of numbers indicating which file headers
       are to be changed.
    
   :n1 n2 ...:  Integers indicating the file headers to be changed.
    
    
   :field:  The name of a SAC header variable.  These variables are listed
       in SAC_Format_.  Also, field may be the keyword ALLT
       as discussed below.  Note, in order to maintain internal consistency,
       the following header variables cannot be changed with CHNHDR_:
       NVHDR, NPTS, NWFID, NORID, and NEVID.
    
   :v:  Set the value of that field to v.  The type of the field and its
       new value must match.  Use single quotes for alphanumeric fields
       with embedded blanks.  Use TRUE or FALSE for logical fields.  YES or
       NO are also acceptable for logical fields.  Use variable names (see
       SAC_Format_) for value fields.  For offset time fields (B, E, O, A, F,
       and Tn), v may also be of the form -- GMT v1 v2 v3 v4 v5 v6 where v1,
       v2, v3, v4, v5, and v6 are the GMT year, day-of-year, hour, minute,
       second, and millisecond of the time.  If v1 is a two-digit number,
       SAC will assume it is in the current century, unless that would mean
       that the year is in the future, in which case, SAC assumes the
       previous century.  To be certain you get what you want, use four
       digits.
    
   :UNDEF:  Use this keyword instead of v to "undefine" a header field.
    
   :ALLT v:  Add v seconds to all defined header times.  Subtract v
       seconds from the reference time.
    
DESCRIPTION
-----------
   This command lets you change any of SAC's header fields.
   A specific file or list of files can be changed by specifying the
   integer value(s) corresponding to the order in which the file(s)
   were read in.  If no integer filelist is specified, all files in memory
   will have their header fields changed.  To change the headers of the
   files on disk, follow this command with the WRITE_ or WRITEHDR_ command.
   SAC does some validity checking on the new values but you may want to
   verify the results using the LISTHDR_ command.
   
   There are dight enumerated (I type) variaables, such as IZTYPE, IDEP, and
   IZTYPE.  These are explained and options listed in SAC_FORMAT_.
   
   There is a set of six variables in the header (NZYEAR, NZJDAY, NZHOUR,
   NZMIN, NZSEC, and NZMSEC) that contain the reference or "zero" time of the
   file.  This is the only GMT in the SAC header.  All other times in the header
   (B, E, O, A, F, and Tn) are offsets in seconds relative to this reference
   time.  You may change the reference time and all of the defined offset times
   by using the "ALLT v" option.  That number of seconds are added to each
   defined offset time.  That same number of seconds is also subtracted from the
   reference time.  This preserves the actual GMT time of the data.  As a
   convenience, you may enter a GMT time instead of a relative time when
   changing the offset times.  When the GMT time is entered it is converted to
   a relative time before storing it in the offset time field.

EXAMPLES
--------
   To define the event latitude, longitude and name in all the files in memory::

      SAC>  CHNHDR EVLA 34.3 EVLO -118.5
      SAC>  CHNHDR KEVNM 'LA goes under'

   To define the event latitude, longitude and name in files 2 and 4::

      SAC>  CHNHDR file 2 4 EVLA 34.3 EVLO -118.5
      SAC>  CHNHDR file 2 4 KEVNM 'LA goes under'

   To change the event type to earthquake::

      SAC>  CHNHDR IEVTYP IQUAKE   

   To set the first arrival time to its undefined state::

      SAC>  CHNHDR A UNDEF   

   Assume you know the GMT origin time of an event and that you want to quickly
   change all the times in the header so that this origin time is the zero or
   reference time and all other offset times are correct relative to this time.
   First set the origin time using the GMT option::

      SAC>  CHNHDR O GMT 1982 123 13 37 10 103
   
   Now use the [L]IST[H]DR command to find out what O is relative to the current
   reference time::

      SAC>  LISTHDR O
      O 123.103

   Now use the ALLT option to subtract this value from all of the offset times
   and add it to the reference time.  You also want to change the field that
   describes the type of reference time stored in these files::

      SAC>  CHNHDR ALLT -123.103 IZTYPE IO

   Notice the minus sign because you are subtracting this value from the offset
   times.

   Alternatively, if you have several waveforms in memory for the same event bur
   with different reference times, after setting O as above, the following command 
   will subtract off the origin time from all defined times for all files and 
   change the reference time to origin time::
   
     SAC> chnhdr allt (0 - &1,o&) IZTYPE IO
