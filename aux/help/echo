DESCRIPTION
-----------
   This commands lets you control which categories of the SAC input and output
   stream is to be echoed to the terminal or screen.  There are three categories
   of output: error messages, warning messages, and output messages.  There are
   three categories of input: commands typed at the terminal, commands executed
   from a macro, and "processed" commands.  A processed command is one in which
   all macro arguments, blackboard variables, header variables, and inline
   functions have been evaluated.  You can control the echoing of these
   categories individually.  When you type a command at your terminal, the
   operating system normally echos each character.  Thus the commands echoing
   option is of limited use for interactive sessions.  The macro and processed
   options are useful when debugging a macro.
