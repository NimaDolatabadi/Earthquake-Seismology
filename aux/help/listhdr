LISTHDR
+++++++

SUMMARY
-------
Lists the values of selected header fields.

SYNTAX
------

  ``LISTHDR {listops} {hdrlist}``
   where listops are one or more of the following:


  ``DEFAULT|PICKS|SPECIAL``

  ``FILES ALL|NONE|list``

  ``COLUMNS 1|2``

  ``INCLUSIVE ON|OFF``


INPUT
-----
   :DEFAULT:  Use the default list, which includes all defined header
       fields.
    
   :PICKS:  Use the picks list, which includes those header fields used to
       define time picks.
    
   :SPECIAL:  Use the special user defined list.
    
   :FILES ALL:  List headers from all files in data file list.
    
   :FILES NONE:  Don't list headers, set defaults for future commands.
    
   :FILES list:  List headers from a subset of the files in the data file
       list.  The subset is defined as a list of file numbers.
    
   :COLUMNS 1:  Format output into a single column of entries.
    
   :COLUMNS 2:  Format output into two columns.
    
   :INCLUSIVE:  ON includes header variables which are undefined.
       OFF excludes them.
    
   :hdrlist:  List of header fields to be included in the special list.
    
DEFAULT VALUES
--------------

  ``LISTHDR DEFAULT FILES ALL COLUMNS 1 INCLUSIVE OFF``

DESCRIPTION
-----------
   The user can define which items to list or can use either of two
   standard lists.  The first list (DEFAULT) contains all of the header
   fields.  The second list (PICKS) contains those header fields which are
   directly or indirectly used to define time picks.  This list contains the
   following fields: B, E, O, A, Tn, KZTIME, KZDATE.  More standard lists can be
   added if needed.  A special list can be defined by the user at any time and
   can then be requested again by using the SPECIAL option.
   The full listing for a header field consists of its name, an equals
   sign, and its current value.  Some of the fields for some files will be
   undefined.  SAC stores a special value in those fields to flag them as
   undefined.  The listing excludes these undefined fields unless the INCLUSIVE
   option is ON.  For integers and floats the undefined value is -12345; for
   character strings and those integers which are used to indicate character
   strings, the undefined value it "UNDEFINED".
   
   If one reads in a waveform file and transforms to the frequency domain, the data
   extremes (MAXDEP, MINDEP) will return values in LH for the time domain, not the
   frequency domain.

   A description of each of the SAC header fields is contained in the manual secion:
   sac_format_.

ERROR MESSAGES
--------------
   1301: No data files read in.


EXAMPLES
--------
   To get a two column listing of the time picks only:

      u:  LISTHDR PICKS COLUMNS 2

   

   To get a default listing of the third and fourth files in the data file list:

      u:  LISTHDR FILES 3 4

   

   To list the values of the begin and end time only:

      u:  LISTHDR B E

   

   To define a special list of the station parameters:

      u:  LISTHDR KSTNM STLA STLO STEL STDP

   

   To reuse this special list later during the same execution:

      u:  LISTHDR SPECIAL

   

   To set default two column output:

      u:  LISTHDR COLUMNS 2 FILES NONE
