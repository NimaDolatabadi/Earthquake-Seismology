DESCRIPTION
-----------
  This command transforms time-series data in memory to spectral data
  containing amplitude and "unwrapped" phase components.  This procedure works
  for data with a "smoothly varying phase." The data is filled with zeros to
  the next power of two before being transformed.  You may specify a larger
  number of zeros by using the FILL option.

  This is an implementation of the algorithm due to Tribolet.  Two methods
  are used to estimate the unwrapped phase at each frequency.  One is to
  numerically integrate the phase derivative through the use of the fast
  Fourier transform.  The step size used in this trapezoidal integration is
  halved at each frequency if necessary to obtain a consistent estimate.  You
  can control the threshold value on this check using the INTTHR option.  This
  value is in radians.  Decreasing INTTHR will improve the phase estimate.  Too
  small a value, however, will not allow the solution to converge.

  The second method used in this algorithm is to first compute the
  principle value of the phase using the inverse tangent function.  The
  unwrapped phase is estimated by adding multiples of 2*PI to the principal
  value until the discontinuities are reduced to values less than a threshold
  value.  You control the threshold value on this check using the PVTHR option.
  Again, decreasing this threshold value will improved the phase estimate, but
  will also increase the chance that no solution may be found.
  Initial trial values for these two thresholds are usually such that::

    PI/4 < PVTHR < INTTHR < 2*PI


ERROR MESSAGES
--------------
- 1301: No data files read in.
- 1306: Illegal operation on unevenly spaced file
- 1606: Maximum allowable DFT is

  - Too many data points in file.

WARNING MESSAGES
----------------
- 1610: Unwrap failed at data point for file

  - Adjust threshold constants and retry.

HEADER CHANGES
--------------
  B, E, and DELTA are changed to the beginning, ending and sampling frequencies
  of the transform respectively.  The original values of B, E, and DELTA are
  saved as SB, SE, and SDELTA and are restored when an inverse transform is
  performed.

LIMITATIONS
-----------
  The maximum length of data that can currently be transformed is 4096.
