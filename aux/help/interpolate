INTERPOLATE
+++++++++++

SUMMARY
-------
Interpolates evenly-spaced data to a new sampling rate.  Interpolate can also be 
used with unevenly-spaced data.

SYNTAX
------
::

    INTERPOLATE {DELTA v} {NPTS n} {BEGIN v}

INPUT
-----
   :DELTA v:  Set new sampling rate to v.
       The time range (E-B) is not changed, so NPTS is changed.
       However, E will be changed so that it is a multiple of DELTA from b.
       Both DELTA and NPTS cannot be used in the same call.
    
   :NPTS n:  Force the number of points in interpolated file to be n.  
       The time range (E-B) is not changed, so DELTA is changed.
       Both DELTA and NPTS cannot be used in the same call.

   :BEGIN v:  Start interpolation at v.  This value becomes the begin time
       of the interpolated file.  BEGIN can be used with either DELTA or 
       NPTS.
    
DEFAULT VALUES
--------------

  The time series is unchanged.

DESCRIPTION
-----------
   This command uses the Wiggins' weighted average-slopes interpolation method 
   (1976, BSSA, 66, p. 2077) to convert unevenly-spaced data to evenly-spaced data 
   but which works quite well at resampling evenly-spaced data to a different 
   sampling rate.  Unlike cubic-spline interpolation, there is no extrema between 
   input sample points.  If the sample rate is decreased, there is no antialiasing, 
   so for downsampling, DECIMATE_ may be a better option.  An alternative to using 
   BEGIN is to CUT_ the time series to the desired B and E before calling 
   INTERPOLATE.  If DELTA and NPTS are in the same call to INTERPOLATE, the last 
   one in the command sequence will be used.
   
   Wiggins' subroutine included EPSILON, which gives a lower limit for local slopes.
   In earlier versions of INTERPOLATE, one could modify EPSILON.  As of the version
   accompanying SAC v101.5, the code has been rewritten so that there is no
   reason to consider modifying EPSILON.  Hence, that option has been removed.

EXAMPLES
--------
   Assume that FILEA is an evenly-spaced data file with a sampling interval of
   0.025.  To convert it to a sampling rate of 0.02 seconds::

      SAC>  READ FILEA
      SAC>  INTERPOLATE DELTA 0.02

   Because the new delta is less than the data delta, a warning message will be
   printed because of the potential for aliasing.
   
   Assume that FILEB has NPTS=3101 and one wants to have it sample the same time
   range but with NPS=4096 points (a power of 2)::
   
      SAC> READ FILEB
      SAC> INTERPOLATE NPTS 4096
      
   If one tries to change DELTA and NPTS in the same call,  only the second call
   will be used.  Hence if the previous call were replaced by::
   
      SAC> READ FILEB
      SAC> INTERPOLATE NPTS 4096 DELTA 0.02
      
   DELTA would be changed to 0.02 and NPTS would be calculated from the new DELTA
   and the input B and E.  If the order were reversed::
   
      SAC> READ FILEB
      SAC> INTERPOLATE DELTA 0.02 NPTS 4096
      
   the output file would have NPTS=4096 and DELTA would be calculated.
   
   Assume that FILEC is an unevenly spaced data file.  To convert it to an evenly
   spaced file with a sampling interval of 0.01 seconds::

      SAC>  READ FILEC
      SAC>  INTERPOLATE DELTA 0.01


WARNING MESSAGES
