STRETCH
+++++++

SUMMARY
-------
Stretches (upsamples) data, including an optional interpolating FIR_ filter.

SYNTAX
------

  ``STRETCH {n},{FILTER {ON|OFF}}``

INPUT
-----
   :n:  Set upsampling factor.  Must be in the range 2 to 7.
    
   :FILTER {ON}:  Turn interpolating filter option on.
    
   :FILTER OFF:  Turn interpolating filter option off.
    
DEFAULT VALUES
--------------

  ``STRETCH 2 FILTER ON``

DESCRIPTION
-----------
   By using the interpolating filter option, this command can be used to create
   a file with a smaller sampling interval (more data points) but which looks
   similar to the original.  Care should be taken when using this command,
   because the filter does effect the frequency content.  When this filter option
   is off, the appropriate number of zeros are simply inserted between each of
   the original data points.
