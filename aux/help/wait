DEFAULT VALUES
--------------

  ``WAIT ON``

DESCRIPTION
-----------
  When you read in more than one data file and then plot them using the PLOT_
  command, one frame is generated for each file.  If you are plotting to the
  terminal, SAC normally pauses after each plot and sends the message "WAITING"
  to the terminal.  You can then hit the return key to see the next plot, type
  "GO" to have SAC plot the rest of the current set of plots without pausing, or
  type "KILL" to terminate the plotting of this set of files.  SAC does not
  pause after the last plot, because the normal input prompt serves the same
  function.  When this wait option is off, SAC does not pause between plots.
  With the wait option in the "every plot" mode SAC will pause between every
  plot, not just the ones generated by the PLOT_ command.  This is useful when
  you are running SAC under the control of a command file or job control
  program.

EXAMPLES
--------
  The following example shows how SAC functions in the normal wait mode::

      u:  READ FILE1 FILE2 FILE3 FILE4
      u:  PLOT
      s:  waiting        {plot of FILE1 to terminal}
      u:  (return)
      u:  waiting        {plot of FILE2}
      u:  kill           {user has seen enough}
      s:  (prompt)       {SAC now waiting for next command}
