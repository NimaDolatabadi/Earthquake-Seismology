PLOT1
+++++

SUMMARY
-------
Generates a multi-trace multi-window plot.

SYNTAX
------

  ``[P]LOT[1] {ABSOLUTE|RELATIVE},{PERPLOT {ON|OFF|n}} {PRINT {pname} }``

INPUT
-----
   :ABSOLUTE:  Plot files treating time as an absolute.  Files with
       different begin times will be shifted relative to each other.
    
   :RELATIVE:  Plot all files relative to their begin time.
    
   :PERPLOT {ON}:  Plot n files per frame.  Use old value for n.
    
   :PERPLOT OFF:  Plot all files on one frame.
    
   :PERPLOT n:  Plot n files per frame.
    
   :PRINT {pname}:  Prints the resulting plot to the printer named in
       pname, or to the default printer if pname is not used.  (This
       makes use of the SGF_ capability.)
    
    
ALTERNATE FORMS
---------------
PERPLOT ALL has the same meaning as PERPLOT OFF.

DEFAULT VALUES
--------------

  ``PLOT1 ABSOLUTE PERPLOT OFF``

DESCRIPTION
-----------
   Each data file shares a common axis in the x direction, but each has a
   separate subplot region in the y direction.  The total size of the plot is
   determined by the current viewport (see XVPORT_ and YVPORT_.) The size of each
   subplot is determined by this viewport and the number of files plotted on
   each frame.  The y axis limits for each subplot can be scaled to that data
   file's extrema or they can have fixed limits.  See the YLIM_ command for
   details.  The x axis limits can also be fixed (see XLIM_) or scaled to the data.
   There are two types of x axis scaling for this type of plot: relative and
   absolute.  In absolute scaling the x axis limits become the smallest minimum
   and the largest maximum for the active memory files. Time differences
   measured between points on different subplots will be correct.  In relative
   scaling mode, the x axis will run from zero to the maximum time differential
   (i.e., the maximum difference between end time and begin time) for the active
   memory files.  Each file will be plotted from the left edge of the plot,
   corresponding to zero on the x axis.  The actual value corresponding to this
   zero for each file will be given below the name of the file.  This type of
   scaling is useful if you are cutting the files relative to some time pick,
   say the first arrival time.  It is then easy to see the similarities or
   differences between the wave forms of each file.  A user
   controllable file identification (see FILEID_) is generated for each file in
   the plot.  Time picks can be displayed (see PICKS_).

EXAMPLES
--------
   The zero time (KZDATE and KZTIME) has been set to the event origin time::

      SAC> READ *V
      ELK.V KNB.V LAC.V MNV.V
      SAC> CUT -5 200
      SAC> READ *V
      ELK.V KNB.V LAC.V MNV.V
      SAC> FILEID LOCATION UL TYPE LIST KSTCMP
      SAC> TITLE 'Regional earthquake:  &1,KZTIME&  &1,KZDATE&'
      SAC> QDP 2000
      SAC> P1

   Note the use of a UNIX wildcard character in the READ_ command, the 
   echoing of the filelist by SAC, the specification of a special file id, 
   and the evaluation of several header variables to create the title.
