SUMMARY
-------
Applies a Hilbert transform.

SYNTAX
------

  ``HILBERT``

DESCRIPTION
-----------
  Each data file, y(n), in the data file list is replaced by its Hilbert
  transform, x(n). The transform is found by convolving y(n) (in the time
  domain) with a 201 point FIR_ filter: The filter impulse response is obtained
  by windowing an ideal Hilbert transformer impulse response with a Hamming
  window: In the frequency domain, this filter approximates the transfer
  function: The phase criterion is met exactly (90 degree phase shift at each
  frequency), and the magnitude response is (ideally) unity. 

  Note that the operation is inexact in small regions about DC and the
  folding frequency.  If transforms are to be taken of very low frequency data,
  such as long period surface waves, the signals should first be decimated.
  Since the transformation is performed in the time domain, computations
  are done in-place using the overlap-save algorithm.  There are no restrictions
  on the length of data file.
  
  (Added in 2013)  Hilbert transforms can be used to calculate the minimum-delay 
  phase from (the log of) the spectral amplitude.  Such amplitudes are effectively
  low-pass filters, which are not band-limited, and the procedure used here does
  not work very well for such functions.
