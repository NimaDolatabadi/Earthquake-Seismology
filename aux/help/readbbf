DESCRIPTION
-----------
   This command lets you read in a blackboard variable file.  This file must have
   been previously written to disk using the WRITEBBF_ command.  This feature lets
   you save information from one execution of SAC to another.  You can also add
   coding to your own programs to access the information in these blackboard
   variable files.  This lets you transfer information between your own programs
   and SAC.  See the SAC Subroutines Reference Manual for details.
