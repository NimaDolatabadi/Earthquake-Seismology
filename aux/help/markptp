+++++++

SUMMARY
-------
Measures and marks the maximum peak to peak amplitude of each signal within
the measurement time window.

SYNTAX
------

  ``MARKPTP {LENGTH v},{TO marker}``

INPUT
-----
   :LENGTH v:  Change the length of the sliding window to v seconds.
    
   :TO marker:  Define the first time marker in the header to store
       results.  The time of the minimum is stored in this marker.  The
       time of the maximum is stored in the next marker.
    
   :marker:  T0|T1|T2|T3|T4|T5|T6|T7|T8|T9
    
DEFAULT VALUES
--------------

  ``MARKPTP LENGTH 5.0 TO T0``

DESCRIPTION
-----------
   This command measures the times and the amplitude of the maximum peak-to-peak
   excursion of the data within the current measurement time window (see MTW.)
   The results are written into the header.  The time of the minimum value
   (valley) is written into the requested marker.  The time of the maximum value
   (peak) is written into the next marker.  The peak-to-peak amplitude is written
   into USER0.  The results are also written into the alphanumeric pick file if
   it is open (see OAFP.)

EXAMPLES
--------
  To set the measurement time window to be between the two header fields, T4
  and T5, and the default sliding window length and marker::

      u:  MTW T4 T5
      u:  MARKPTP

  To set the measurement time window to be the 30 seconds immediately after the
  first arrival, and the sliding window length to to 3 seconds, and the
  starting marker to T7::

      u:  MTW A 0 30
      u:  MARKP L 3. TO T7
