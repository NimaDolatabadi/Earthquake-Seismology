DESCRIPTION

  The blackboard is a place to temporarily store information.  Blackboard

  accessed by the GETBB_ command or used directly in a command by preceeding the
  name of the variable with a percent sign ("%".) This command allows you to
  unset previously defined blackboard variables.  You may unset all variables or
  only a named subset.

EXAMPLES

  To unset several blackboard variables at once::

      u:  UNSETBB C1 C2 X

  To unset all blackboard variables::

      u:  UNSETBB ALL
