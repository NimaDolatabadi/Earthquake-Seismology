DESCRIPTION
-----------
  Many times in a data set, when there are gaps in the data, no data is
  available.  In many cases the data has been set to a predefined value.
  Typical values are 0.0, -1.0, -99.  Usually the user will not want these
  values displayed on plots.  The NULL_ command allows the user to define the
  NULL_ value and not connect a line through these data points.  To set the 
  NULL_ value to -1.0 and enable the NULL_ option during plotting::

      u: NULL ON -1.0
