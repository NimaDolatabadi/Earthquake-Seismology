ADDF
++++

SUMMARY
-------
Adds a set of data files to data in memory.

SYNTAX
------

  ``ADDF {NEWHDR ON|OFF} filelist``

INPUT
-----
   :NEWHDR ON|OFF:  By default, the resultant file will take its
       header field from the original file in memory.
       Turning NEWHDR ON, causes the header fields to be taken from
       the new file in the filelist.
    
   :filelist:  A list of SAC binary data files.  This list may contain
       simple filenames, full or relative pathnames, and wildcard
       characters.  See the READ_ command for a complete description.
    
DESCRIPTION
-----------
   This command can be used to add a single file to a set of files or to add one
   set of files to another set.  An example of each case is presented below.  The
   files must be evenly spaced and should have the same sampling interval and
   number of data points.  These last two restrictions can be eliminated using
   the BINOPERR_ command.  If there are more data files in memory than in the
   filelist, then the last file in the filelist is used for the remainder of the
   data files in memory.

EXAMPLES
--------
   To add one file to three other files::

      u:  READ FILE1 FILE2 FILE3
      u:  ADDF FILE4

   To add two files to two other files::

      u:  READ FILE1 FILE2
      u:  ADDF FILE3 FILE4

HEADER CHANGES
--------------
   If NEWHDR is OFF (the default) the headers in memory are unchanged).
   If NEWHDR is ON, the headers are replaced with the headers from the
   files in the filelist.
