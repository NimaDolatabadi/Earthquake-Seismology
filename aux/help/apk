DESCRIPTION
-----------
   The algorithm used in this automatic picker was originally obtained
   from the USGS in Menlo Park and is based upon work by Rex Allen (see
   reference below.) The detection of a pick is based upon abrupt changes in the
   ratio of a short term and long term running average of the signal.  Once
   detected, the pick is subjected to an optional validation phase which
   attempts to distinguish a true event from cultural noise.  Once validated, the
   pick is further evaluated to determine other characteristics of the event.
   Currently this is limited to its duration.  Other features such as maximum
   amplitude, period, and decay rate may be added as required.
   Most of the parameters in this command need never be changed.  They are
   available if the user wishes to fine tune the algorithm.  Most of these
   parameters have the same meaning here as they do in the referenced article.

   1.  C1 is the constant used in the recursive high pass filter that is
   applied to remove any D.C. bias.

   2.  C2 is the constant used to vary the weight assigned to the
   amplitude and first difference in the characteristic function.

   3.  C3 is the timing constant, used to compute the short term average
   of the characteristic function.

   4.  C4 is the timing costant used to compute the long term average
   of the characteristic function.

   5.  C5 is the constant used to compute the threshold reference level.
   A potential event is declared when the short term average becomes larger
   than C5 times the long term average.


   6.  C6 is the timing constant used to compute the running mean absolute
   value of the filtered data.

   7.  A station is assumed to be dead when the absolute value of the
   characteristic function is greater than C7.

   8.  C8 is used to determine the signal termination level.
   The signal is terminated when its absolute value falls below this
   level for D8 seconds.
   There are currently two different algorithms in use so C8 has two
   different interpretations.
   If C8 is positive, then the termination level is C8 times the
   running mean absolute value of the signal just before the event was
   declared.
   This method is useful if the background level at a station is large.
   If C8 is negative, then the termination level is the absolute value
   of C8.
   This will give more consistent terminations from station to station
   if the noise level is well below this termination level.

   9.  D5 is the minimum duration in seconds for an event
   to be declared valid.

   10.  D9 is the duration in seconds used to initialize the long term
   average of the characteristic function.

   11.  I3, I4, and I6 are integer constants used during the
   validation phase and should not be changed.


HEADER CHANGES
--------------
  The time of the pick is stored into A; the quality and sense of motion is
  stored into KA; the end of the event is stored into F.
