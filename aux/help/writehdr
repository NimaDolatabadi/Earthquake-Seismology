WRITEHDR
++++++++

SUMMARY
-------
Overwrites the headers on disk with those in memory.

SYNTAX
------

  ``WRITEHDR {COMMIT|ROLLBACK|RECALLTRACE}``

INPUT
-----
   :COMMIT:  Commits headers and waveforms in SAC memory -- removing any
       previous versions of headers or waveforms from RAM -- prior
       to writing files.  COMMIT is the default.
    
   :ROLLBACK:  reverts to the last committed version of the header and
       waveform before writing files.
    
   :RECALLTRACE:

       - reverts to the last committed version of the waveform,
       - reverts to the last committed version of those header
       	 variables closely linked to the waveform,
       - commits those header variables which are loosely linked
         to the waveform.  (use HELP_ RECALLTRACE for a list of 
	 which header variables are committed, and which are rolled back.)

DEFAULT VALUES
--------------

  ``WRITEHDR COMMIT``

DESCRIPTION
-----------
  The data on disk is NOT overwritten by this command.  Use the WRITE_ OVER
  command to overwrite headers and data.  The WRITEHDR_ command should NEVER be
  used if the CUT_ option is on.  The header in memory is modified to reflect 
  the effects of the CUT_, but the data on disk is not modified.  
  Use of the WRITEHDR_ command on cut data files will have the effect 
  of apparently shifting and truncating the data on disk in time.

ERROR MESSAGES
--------------
- 1301: No data files read in.

HEADER CHANGES
--------------
  Updates headers on disk.

LIMITATIONS
-----------
  See description above about use of CUT_ and WRITEHDR_.
