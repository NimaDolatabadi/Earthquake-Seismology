BINOPERR
++++++++

SUMMARY
-------
Controls errors that can occur during binary file operations.

SYNTAX
------

  ``BINOPERR {NPTS FATAL|WARNING|IGNORE},``

  ``{DELTA FATAL|WARNING|IGNORE}``

INPUT
-----
   :NPTS:  Change error condition for unequal number of data points.
    
   :DELTA:  Change error condition for unequal sampling intervals.
    
   :FATAL:  Make error condition fatal.  Control is immediately returned
       to the user's terminal.  Additional commands typed on the same line
       or in the same command file are ignored.
    
   :WARNING:  Send a warning message to the user.  Correct the error
       condition and continue.
    
   :IGNORE:  Correct the error condition and continue.
    
DEFAULT VALUES

  ``BINOPERR NPTS FATAL DELTA FATAL``

DESCRIPTION
-----------
  SAC checks for certain common errors whenever you execute a binary
  operations module command (ADDF, DIVF_, etc.) Using this command, you can
  control what SAC does when it finds one of these errors.
  If you make an error condition fatal, then SAC will stop executing the
  current command, will ignore all commands in its queue, will print an error
  message to the terminal, and will return control to you.  If you make an error
  condition a warning, then SAC will send you a warning message, correct the
  condition as best it can, and continue.  If you tell SAC to ignore a
  condition, then SAC will correct the condition and continue without telling
  you the condition even occurred.

  One of these error conditions occurs when the number of data points in
  the two files to be operated on are not equal.  Corrective action in this case
  is to perform the operation using the number of data points in the smaller
  file.

  Another error condition occurs when the sampling intervals of the two
  files are not the same.  The corrective action in this case is to use the
  sampling interval of the first data file.

EXAMPLES
--------
  Assume that FILE1 has 1000 data points and FILE2 has 950 data points.::

      u:  BINOPERR NPTS FATAL
      u:  READ FILE1
      u:  ADDF FILE2
      u:  ERROR:  Header field mismatch: NPTS FILE1 FILE2

  The file addition was not performed.  Assume you now type::

      u:  BINOPERR NPTS WARNING
      u:  ADDF FILE2
      u:  WARNING:  Header field mismatch: NPTS FILE1 FILE2

  The file addition was performed on the first 950 data points of each file.
