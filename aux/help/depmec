   The following is a hands on description of how to use DepMec V1.0.
   It assumes that you have version 59 or later of sac2000 and
   have the appropriate matlab licences and libraries.

   *** System Preparation:

   Make sure your SACAUX and MATLABPATH environments are set.

   *** Data preparation:

   Depmec will work with any vertical component velocity or
   displacement data that can be read into sac, provided the
   appropriate SAC data headers are set.
   You may find it useful to store your data in event based directories.


   The following SAC headers should be set:

   reference time (nzyear nzjday nzhour nzmin nzsec nzmsec)
   origin time (o) should be zero.
   reference time type (iztype=io) (The origin time should be the reference time)
   * If necessary, you can use the following to set a reference origin time.
   ch o GMT year jday hour min sec msec (only if origin isn't already set)
   ch allt (0. - &1,o )
   event latitude (evla)
   event longitude (evlo)
   event depth (evdp)
   event magnitude (mag)
   data type, velocity or displacement (idep)
   station lat (stla)
   station lon (stlo)
   station name (kstnm)
   component name (kcmpnm)


   (Optional) Pick first arrivals and store in T0 sac header.
   If no picks are defined, depmec will set the first arrivals using the
   default velocity model (currently AK135).  The user can also repick
   these interactively in depmec.


   *** Depth and Mechanism estimation ***

   At this point it is assumed that you are running SAC2000
   and have read in data with properly loaded headers (see above).



   1) To start depmec type:

   depmec

   (You should see the matlab insignia flash by, a waitbar saying
   loading initialization file will popup and disappear and then
   the main depmec window will appear with menus across the top.)

   Before analysing the data there are a number of preferences you
   may want to set under the edit and preferences menus.  However,
   if you are just getting started, I'd suggest using the defaults.
   Further discussion of the preferences is given below.



   2) Load the data using the file menu.
   You can use either displacements or velocity.
   Displacements may be better if the SNR is large
   at low frequencies because there are fewer concerns
   about cycle skipping when doing the cross-correlation
   to estimate the misfit.
   However, velocities have potentially higher resolution
   and work better when the low-frequency SNR is poor.

   Click file>Load SAC Velocity

   If your data have the necessary headers loaded and are within
   an appropriate distance range 15 to 90 degrees they will
   plotted along with synthetics and a mechanism beachball in
   the main window.



   * Most of the following involves using tools started by
   * clicking on Icons at the top of the depmec main window.
   * If you can't figure out what a particular Icon is for
   * place your cursor over the icon and an short
   * explanation should appear.

   3) Picking and Filtering:
   If you haven't already done so, you may want to filter and
   pick or repick some of the traces.

   The easiest way to do this is to open both the single trace
   pick window (Icon with single trace and pick mark), and the
   filtering window (Icon with spectrum and F in upper right).


   It is usuall best to begin by applying some nominal filtering
   to the data and then remove traces with very poor SNR.

   While the main window and the picking and filter window are
   all visible, adjust filter parameters by selecting the
   the filter type and corners then selecting assign to all.
   Then apply this filter to all the data with the button to
   the left of the close box in the upper right corner.
   If these filter parameters are unacceptable, filter selected
   traces by stepping through the data with the red arrows at
   the top of the pick and filter windows.

   After a preliminary filtering of the data, traces with poor
   SNR can be deleted using the wastebasket icon on in the
   pick window.  Alternatively, you can deselect a trace by
   clicking the check box to the left of a trace or the check
   mark icon in the pick tool window.  This changes the color
   of the trace to gray and leaves it visible but it will not
   be used to estimate the depth or mechanism.


   To adjust the picks point the cursor at the vertical black
   line labeled P and use the middle mouse button to drag it
   to the desired pick location.  The size and location of the
   pick window can be adjusted using the grey box enclosing
   the current trace in the main window.  Point to the edge
   and use the middle mouse button to drag the whole window
   or point to the bowtie handle on the right hand side and
   drag to reduce or enlarge the lengthe of the window.  You
   can also drag this gray box to another trace and the pick
   and filter windows will be updated appropriately.


   When the picks and filters are satisfactory close the pick
   and filter windows and click the floppy disk icon at the top
   of the main menu to store these parameters in the SAC data
   headers.
   *** Note that these pick and filter parameters are not
   *** permanently written in the SAC data files unless you
   *** save them with write or writeheader after closing depmec.
   *** To close depmec you use the closebox icon at the upper right
   *** of the main window.


   4) (optional) Estimate magnitude:
   You can estimate the magnitude by turning the
   Auto-calculate Magnitude on under preferences.
   However, the magnitude returned when using velocities
   is still currently under development.


   *** Event parameter estimation

   5) Perform a fast grid search data for depth and mechanism
   by clicking the main window icon with the lightening bolt
   over a grid.  Even with a lot of data this only takes a few
   minutes on an Ultra-Sparc with a ~300 MHz processor.

   If you have lots of data or are impatient, you can
   speed things up by deselecting all but the best SNR
   traces.  This will often give a reasonable preliminary
   fit to the data which can be iteratively improved upon
   by reselecting the rest of the traces and using the
   simplex method (diamond or kite shaped Icon) to refine
   the solution.

   Estimate errors by clicking on the bootstraping icon
   (the boot with a strap next to the simplex tool).
   This can take 10 or more minutes so it may be better
   to run this in batch mode if you have many events to
   look at.


   6) Storing/Saving:

   Filters, Picks, Source Parameters and filelist:

   If you select Save SAC Data under the file menu, or click
   on the floppy disk Icon with the S on it the filter, pick,
   and estimated parameters will be stored in the SAC file headers.
   This will also create a new de2RestrictFile file with a list
   of the files that are currently visible.  This file can be
   used as a SAC macro to read in selected data for future analysis.
   You can also save the estimated source parameters to a text
   file using the "add current solution to log file" Icon or the
   option on the file menu.

   Preferences:

   When you exit depmec it will write a file called de2.ini that
   contains your preferences. The next time you start depmec in this
   directory it will read this file.  You can copy this file to other
   directories if you want to use it with other data.



   7) Setting Preferences:

   If necessary, modify the default parameters using the edit
   and preferences menus.

   If you're running depmec for the first time in the current
   directory or you've removed any previously generated de2.ini
   files you should find that most default preferences such as
   automatic magnitude calculation, and filtering are off.

   Under the edit menu the key parameters are

   a) max correlation lag
   This determines how much the first arrival can be shifted.
   If you think your picks are really good set this to zero.

   b) max isotropic percent
   This determines how big an isotropic component depmec will
   allow for in the moment tensor.  For events deeper than
   a few km (e.g., earthquakes) this is best left as zero or
   small since it is another free parameter. However, can
   be useful to test hypotheses when looking at shallow
   events.

   c) min synthetic length (T_sP - T_P):
   Initially this should be long enough to encompass any
   of the modeled arrivals over the depth range of interest.
   For events shallower than 70 km 25-30 s should be enough.

   * Be careful!  If this is too short you can force depmec to
   find a shallow depth source.  However, This could be useful for
   hypothesis testing with a limited number of noisy stations
   or stations with large site effects where you only want
   to fit the initial part of the waveform.


   Under the prefereneces menu the key parameters are:

   a) S/N cutoff:  I usually start with this at .1 and remove traces interactively.

   b) Data selection:

   - file mask: This determines what data files get read in.
   - pre pick length:
   - post pick length:
   - min delta: Current default is 15 deg but beware of triplication before 30 deg
   - max delta: current default is 90 deg

   c) Auto filter traces: will automatically filter data when read in using
   filter parameters stored in SAC headers.
   d) Auto calculate Magnitude: Will calculate magnitude from the data
   based on an estimated corner frequency, the assumed stress drop (see
   edit menu), an assumed circular crack model, and the Kanamori and Anderson
   Moment-Magnitude relation.  This works well with good snr displacement
   data but still needs work in the velocity domain

   e) Use Restriction File: If selected, depmec will read from the list of
   files specified in the de2RestrictFile file in the current data directory.
