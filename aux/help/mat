MAT
+++

SUMMARY
-------
Copy SAC workspace into Matlab and either execute a user-specified
m-file or else get a Matlab prompt for interactive manipulation.
The SAC workspace is updated with changes made to the data after
the return from Matlab.

SYNTAX
------

  ``MAT [mfile]``


DESCRIPTION
-----------
   The mat command allows processing of SAC data from within SAC
   using the Matlab (Version 5) engine and any user-written m-files.
   When this command is executed, the SAC workspace is copied into
   the following Matlab variables:
   SeisData      --- an M-points by N-traces array of waveforms.
   SACdata   	 --- an M-element structure array containing the
   header information from the SAC workspace.
   BlackBoard    --- a structure array containing any blackboard
   variables.

SEISDATA
--------
If the SAC data are time-domain, the SeisData array is real. Other
wise it is complex. However, be aware that the default behavior of
SAC's fft command is to produce transformed data in amplitude-phase
format while in Matlab, the data will be treated as real-imaginary.
The easiest way around that is to use the rlim option with SAC's
fft.

You must return trace data from Matlab to SAC in the same domain
as it was in before the mat command was executed. Otherwise,
changes to the trace data made in Matlab will not be preserved.
Also, you must not change the length of the traces in Matlab.

SACDATA
-------
The SACdata structure array contains the following elements:
times
station
event
user
descrip
evsta
llnl
response
trcLen

Most of these elements are themselves structures and their members
are as follows:

===== ======= ======= ======== ======== ====== ========
times station event   user     descrip  evsta  llnl
===== ======= ======= ======== ======== ====== ========
delta stla    evla    data(10) iftype   dist   xminimum

===== ======= ======= ======== ======== ====== ========

response is a 10-element array, and trcLen is a scalar. Thus, to
reference the begin time for the 10th trace in memory you would
write:
SACdata(10).times.b

To reference the first 4 characters of the station name for the
first trace, you would write:
SACdata(1).station.kstnm(1:4)

BLACKBOARD
The BlackBoard variable is also a structure array which will be
missing if you have no numeric or string black board variables in
the SAC workspace. Otherwise there is an element for each black
board variable. Each element is a structure containing a name
and a value. You cannot create new black board variables in
Matlab (If you do, the changes will not be saved). However, you
can modify the ones passed from SAC to Matlab. So, if your Matlab
script will create a number of output quantities that you want
to store in SAC's blackboard, create the variables in SAC before
executing the mat command.

MATLAB PATH
-----------
By default, the Matlab path available to you from within SAC will
consist of the current directory, ~/matlab and the $MATLAB
hierarchy. You can add an additional directory to the Matlab path
from within SAC using the SETMAT command (SETMAT directoryName).
Also, from within Matlab, you can modify the search path command
using the path command. (Type help path for more information).

EXITING THE MATLAB INTERPRETER
------------------------------
There are two ways to exit the Matlab interpreter and return to SAC.
You can type "exitmat" at the  SACMAT>> prompt. This will return
you to SAC and leave the engine running. This can be useful if you
intend to move back and forth between the two environments
frequently, since there is no delay associated with starting the
Matlab engine. However, a Matlab license will be tied up while you
are running SAC and this may inconvenience other users who cannot
start a session. To exit the Matlab interpreter and/or close the
engine, type "closemat" at either the SACMAT>> or the SAC> prompt.

HEADER CHANGES
--------------
   Potentially all. User is responsible for consistency of changes.

EXAMPLE
-------
Execute an m-file that converts the data to their absolute
values. Assume the m-file is named absv.m and contains the one line
SeisData=abs(SeisData)::

   u:  mat absv

NOTES
-----
You may find it easier to develop a complex m-file directly from
Matlab rather than from within the SAC-Matlab environment. The
primary reasons are that there is no command line recall at the
SACMAT>> prompt and because SACMAT does not trap ^C (used to stop
errant m-files in Matlab). The easiest way to do this is to load
your data into SAC, start the Matlab engine with mat, and then
type save. This will save the workspace in a file called matlab.mat.
You may then start a normal matlab session, and type load. This will
load matlab.mat and you may then develop your application within
Matlab.

The entire range of plotting commands are available. However, if
you execute your m-file from SAC (i.e. mat mfilename) Matlab will
return to SAC immediately after executing the last command in the
m-file. Therefore, if you want to look at your plots created in
Matlab either execute the m-file from the Matlab command line, or
execute a pause in your Matlab script::

  plot(SeisData)
  pause(10)
