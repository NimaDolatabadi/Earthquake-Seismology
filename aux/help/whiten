WHITEN
++++++

SUMMARY
-------
Flattens the spectrum of the input time series.

SYNTAX
------

  ``WHITEN {N} {FILTERDESIGN|FD}``

INPUT
-----
  :N:  The order (number of poles).  The higher this number, the flatter the
       resultent data.  High orders can clean the data up better, but they can
       clean the data up too much, and important data can be lost if the order
       is set too high.  The default is 6.
    
  :FD: Performs something akin to the filterdesign command.  Using the whitening
       coefficients, it designs the whitening filter.  Output is written to
       disc as a set of three output files per input file.  Output files have
       the following suffixes:  

         - .imp = impulse response, 
	 - .spec = spectral

       responses (amplitude and phase), and .gd = group delay.  Note that while
       the group delay claims to be a time series file, it is really a frequency
       series.
    
DEFAULT VALUES
--------------

  ``WHITEN 6``

DESCRIPTION
-----------
  Add white noise to the data.  Flattens the spectrum of the input time series.
  When this is performed prior to the spectral commands (like those in SPE_, or
  transfer or spectrogram), it reduces the dynamic range of the spectral values,
  and improves the accuracy of the overall operation at high frequencies for
  seismic data.

  **Note**  WHITEN_ can be called from within the SPE_ subprocess, or from SAC's
  main shell.  The WHITEN_ in SPE_ maintains the order separately from
  the WHITEN_ in the main shell.  From the main shell, you can
  call WHITEN_ 4.  Future calls to WHITEN_ from the main shell will have
  an order of 4, but calls to WHITEN_ in SPE_ will still have order of 6,
  unless it is changed at the commandline in SPE_.  Furthermore, the
  order in SPE_ is the same as the order related to the PREWHITEN option
  in SPE's COR command (setting one sets the other).  Also the order in
  the main shell's WHITEN_ command is the same as the order in the
  TRANSFER_ command's PREWHITEN option.
