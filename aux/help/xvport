   :xvmin:  X axis viewport minimum value.  Must be in the range 0.0 to
       xvmax.
    
   :xvmax:  X axis viewport maximum.  Must be in the range xvmin to 1.0.
    
DEFAULT VALUES

  ``XVPORT 0.1 0.9``

DESCRIPTION
-----------
   The viewport is the portion of the viewspace (see VSPACE_ command) in
   which the actual plot is drawn.  The coordinate system used to define the
   viewspace and viewport is called a virtual coordinate system.  A virtual
   coordinate system does not depend upon the size, shape, or resolution of a
   particular physical device's display surface.  SAC's coordinate system runs
   from 0.0 to 1.0 in both the x and y directions.  The lower left hand corner of
   the viewspace is the point (0.0, 0.0) and the upper right hand corner of the
   viewspace is the point (1.0, 1.0).  (See the figure on the next page.) The
   use of this coordinate system lets you position a plot without worrying about
   a specific output device.
   The XVPORT_ and YVPORT_ commands control where in the viewspace a
   specific plot is to be drawn.  The default values use most of the viewspace
   for the plot while leaving some room on each side for axes, labels, and a title.
   You can place a particular plot anywhere you want using these commands.  When
   used in conjunction with the BEGINFRAME_ and ENDFRAME_ commands, these commands
   let you create your own special layout by putting several different plots on
   the same frame.

--------
   See the example in the BEGINFRAME_ documentation.
