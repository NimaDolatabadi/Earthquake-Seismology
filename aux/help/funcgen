+++++++

SUMMARY
-------
Generates a function and stores it in memory.

SYNTAX
------

  ``FUNCGEN {type},{DELTA v},{NPTS n},{BEGIN v}``

   where type is one of the following:

  ``IMPULSE``

  ``STEP``

  ``BOXCAR``

  ``TRIANGLE``

  ``SINE {v1 v2}``

  ``LINE {v1 v2}``

  ``QUADRATIC {v1 v2 v3}``

  ``CUBIC {v1 v2 v3 v4}``

  ``SEISMOGRAM``

  ``RANDOM {v1 v2}``

  ``IMPSTRIN  {n1 n2 ... nN}``

INPUT
-----
   :IMPULSE:  Impulse at central data point.
    
   :IMPSTRIN:  A series of impulses at the specified sample points.
    
   :STEP:  Step function.  Zero in first half.  One in second half.
    
   :BOXCAR:  Boxcar function.  Zero in first and last thirds.  One in
       middle third.
    
   :TRIANGLE:  Triangle function.  Zero in first and last quarters.
       Linearly increasing from zero to one in second quarter and
       decreasing from one to zero in third quarter.
    
   :SINE {v1 v2}:  Sine wave with frequency in Hz given by v1 and phase
       angle in degrees given by v2.  Amplitude is one.
   :Note that there is a factor of 2*pi in the phase argument:
       function = 1.0 * sin (2 * Pi * f * t)
    
   :LINE {v1 v2}:  Linear function with slope given by v1 and intercept
       by v2.
    
   :QUADRATIC {v1 v2 v3}:  Quadratic function of the form: ,BREAK ,TEX
       v1*t^{2} + v2*t + v3
    
   :CUBIC {v1 v2 v3 v4}:  Cubic function of the form: ,BREAK ,TEX
       v1*t^{3} + v2*t^{2} + v3*t + v4
    
   :SEISMOGRAM:  Sample seismogram.  This is an obsolete option that has
       been replaced by the DATAGEN_ command.  The DELTA, NPTS, and BEGIN
       options are ignored for this function.  There are 1000 points in the
       sample seismogram.
    
   :RANDOM {v1 v2}:  Random sequence (Gausian white noise) generator.  v1
       is the number of random sequence files to generate and v2 is the
       "seed" used to generate the first random number.  This seed value is
       stored in USER0 so that you can regenerate the same random sequence
       at a later time if desired.
    
   :DELTA v:  Set increment between samples to v.  Stored in header as
       DELTA.
    
   :NPTS n:  Set number of data points in function to n.  Stored in header
       as NPTS.
    
   :BEGIN v:  Set begin time to v.  Stored in header as BEGIN.
    
DEFAULT VALUES
--------------

  ``FUNCGEN IMPULSE NPTS 100 DELTA 1.0 BEGIN 0.``
 
  Frequency and phase angle for SINE function are 0.05 and 0.  
  Coefficients for LINE, QUADRATIC, and CUBIC are all 1.  Number of 
  random sequences is 1 and seed is 12357.

DESCRIPTION
-----------
   Executing this command is equivalent to reading a single file (except for the
   RANDOM option in which more than one file can be generated) into memory whose
   name is the name of the function generated.  Any data previously in memory is
   destroyed.  Other functions will be added as needed.

   Any command which loads data into memory is monitored to maintain a
   level of confidence in the event infomation when transfered from the SAC
   data buffer to the CSS data buffer.  When FUNCGEN_ is used, the confidence
   is set to LOW, indicating that SAC should consider any matching event IDs
   as artifacts and reassign the event ID of the incoming file.  For more
   details, use HELP_ READ_.


HEADER CHANGES

   A header is set up in memory which accurately describes the function
   generated.
