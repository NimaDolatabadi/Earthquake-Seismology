LOWPASS
+++++++

SUMMARY
-------
Applies an IIR lowpass filter.

SYNTAX
------

  ``LOWPASS {BUTTER|BESSEL|C1|C2},{CORNER v},``

  ``{NPOLES n},{PASSES n},{TRANBW v},{ATTEN v}``

INPUT
-----
   :BUTTER:  Apply a Butterworth filter.
    
   :BESSEL:  Apply a Bessel filter.
    
   :C1:  Apply a Chebyshev Type I filter.
    
   :C2:  Apply a Chebyshev Type II filter.
    
   :CORNER v:  Set corner frequency to v.
    
   :NPOLES n:  Set number of poles to n {range: 1-10}.
    
   :PASSES n:  Set number of passes to n {range: 1-2}.
    
   :TRANBW v:  Set the Chebyshev transition band width to v.
    
   :ATTEN v:  Set the Chebyshev attenuation factor to v.
    
DEFAULT VALUES
--------------

  ``LOWPASS BUTTER CORNER 0.4 NPOLES 2 PASSES 1 TRANBW 0.3 ATTEN 30.``

DESCRIPTION
-----------
   See the BANDPASS_ command for definitions of the filter parameters and
   descriptions on how to use them.

EXAMPLES
--------
  To apply a four-pole Butterworth with a corner at 2 Hz.::

      u:  LOWPASS NPOLES 4 CORNER 2

  To apply a two-pole two-pass Bessel with the same corner.::

      u:  LP N 2 BE P 2
      
  A Butterworth causal low-pass filter will time shift (forward) the waveform
  by an amount that depends on the corner frequency.  The following macro will
  time-shift the data::
  
    *  Time shift a time series $1 by $2  Output $1-TS
    *  If IZTYPE = IB, macro will not work.
    *
    setbb wf $1
    setbb ts $2
    r %wf
    ch b (%ts + &1,b&)
    write %wf%-TS
    
  If the macro is named time-shift.m, the waveform file named XXX and the time 
  shift -0.25, the following sequence will time-shift the data and output a file
  named XXX-TS.  This macro will fail if IZTYPE is IB::
  
    SAC> m time-shift.m XXX -0.25
    
ERROR MESSAGES
--------------
- 1301: No data files read in.
- 1306: Illegal operation on unevenly spaced file
- 1307: Illegal operation on spectral file
- 1002: Bad value for

  - corner frequency larger than Nyquist frequency.  See Chapter 4 of Rabiner
    and Gold, Theory and Application of Digital Signal Processing, 
    Prentice-Hall, 1975 for a discussion of IIR filters.
