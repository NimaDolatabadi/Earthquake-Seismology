WINDOW
++++++

SUMMARY
-------
Sets the location and aspect ratio of graphics windows.

SYNTAX
------

  ``WINDOW n {XSIZE xwmin xwmax} {YSIZE ywmin ywmax} {ASPECT [ value | ON | OFF ]}``

INPUT
-----
   :n:  The graphics window number of interest.  There are a total of five
       possible graphics windows.
    
   :X xwmin xwmax:  Set the x (horizontal) location of graphics window n
       on the screen.  xwmin is the location of the left edge of the window
       and xwmax is the location of the right edge.  The range of these
       screen coordinates is 0.0 to 1.0.
    
   :Y ywmin ywmax:  Set the y (vertical) location of graphics window n on
       the screen.  ywmin is the location of the bottom edge of the window
       and ywmax is the location of the top edge.  The range of these
       screen coordinates is 0.0 to 1.0.
    
   :ASPECT value:  If ASPECT is ON (the default), xwmax is not used and the xsize 
       is set so that the aspect ratio (xsize/ysize) on the screen for the 
       window is value if given or the default if no value is explicitly 
       included.  If a xsize is not followed by ASPECT on the command line, 
       ASPECT is effectively OFF and xwmax is used.  xwmin is always used.
    
Default settings::

       n  xwmin  xwmax  ywmin  ywmax
       1  0.05   0.65   0.45   0.95
       2  0.07   0.67   0.43   0.93
       3  0.09   0.69   0.41   0.91
       4  0.11   0.71   0.39   0.89
       5  0.13   0.73   0.37   0.87
       
       ASPECT is ON and set to 11.0/8.5 = 1.294, so xwmax is not used.

DESCRIPTION
-----------
  Most graphics terminals and workstations support multiple "windows."  
  Different jobs or activities can run in each window and display their 
  results on the screen at the same time.  "X-windows" is the (X11) window system
  supported by SAC.

  The BEGINWINDOW_ command lets you select the window in which to display 
  subsequent plots.  BEGINWINDOW will create the requested window -- erasing its
  contents, if it already existed.  If one wants to change a setting from the
  default setting, the WINDOW command must be called BEFORE a call to BEGINWINDOW.
  On most systems the user can also move and resize these windows  dynamically 
  using the mouse and pop-up menus.  Generally but not always (you should check for 
  yourself), the moving of a window will result in the current plot being redrawn
  automatically, whereas the resizing of a window results in the current plot being 
  redrawn but not rescaled.  The next plot in a resized window  will be scaled correctly.
  
  Window choice n=1 is the default window.  Its left side is near the left of the display 
  and is towards the top of the display.  If your window from which you are running SAC 
  is towards the bottom of the display, on many systems you can be typing commands while 
  looking at the plot.  Default windows 2 through 5 are moved down and to the right
  by 0.02 screen units for as n is incremented.  Depending on your platform and display,
  having these options for windows being displayed at the same time makes it efficient
  to compare the displays for windows with different values of n. All five of the above
  windows have the same aspect ratio.
  
  If ASPECT is OFF, the aspect ratio of the displayed window depends on the aspect ratio of 
  the screen.  Older terminals typically had an x:y aspect ratio of 4:3; newer ones are more
  varied, but many have an aspect ratio of 16:10.  On a 4:3 screen, the default window has an
  aspect ratio of 1.6:1, and on a 16:10 screen the aspect ratio is 1,9:1.  SGF_ files have
  a fixed aspect ratio of 4:3.

EXAMPLES
--------
  To change from the default (n=1) to n=2 giving more space at the left of the screen::

      SAC> window 1 x 0.25 0.85
      SAC> beginwindow 1
      
  The y limits will be unchanged.  If the xsize are explicitly stated, ASPECT is set to OFF.
  Note that the order matters::
  
      SAC> window 1 ASPECT 1.33 x 0.25 0.85
      SAC> beginwindow 1
  
  will give the same answer as the previous command sequence because later items on the
  command line take precedence.  However, ::
  
      SAC> window 1 x 0.25 0.85 ASPECT (4.0 / 3.0)
      SAC> beginwindow 1
  
  will ignore xwmax and fix the aspect ratio to 4/3 = 1.33.
  
  To get the n=3 window from previous versions of SAC, enter the following::
  
      SAC> window 3 x 0.05 0.85 y 0.05 0.60
      SAC> beginwindow 3
