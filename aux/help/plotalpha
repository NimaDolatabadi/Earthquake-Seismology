PLOTALPHA
+++++++++

SUMMARY
-------
Reads alphanumeric data files on disk into memory and plots the data to the
current output device.  This differs from readalpha followed by plot because
it allows you to plot a label with each data point.

SYNTAX
------

  ``READALPHA {options}  {filelist}``

   where options is one or more of the following:

  ``MORE``

  ``DIR CURRENT|name``

  ``FREE|FORMAT text``

  ``CONTENT text``

  ``PRINT {printer}``


  ``ALL options MUST preceed any element in the filelist.``

  The last two options may also be placed on the first line of file itself.

INPUT
-----
   :MORE:  Append the new data files after the old ones in memory.  If
       this option is missing, the new data replaces the old data in memory.
       See the READ_ command for more details about this option.
    
   :DIR CURRENT:  Read and plot all simple filenames (with or without
       wildcards) from the current directory.  This is the directory from
       which you started SAC.
    
   :DIR name:  Read and plot all simple filenames (with or without
       wildcards) from the directory called name.  This may be a relative
       or absolute directory name.
    
   :FREE:  Read and plot the data in the filelist in free format (space
       delimited) mode.
    
   :FORMAT text:  Read and plot the data in the filelist in fixed format
       mode.  The format statement to use is given in text.
    
   :CONTENT text:  Define the content of the data in the filelist.  The
       meaning of the content text is described below.
    
   :PRINT {pname}:  Print the resultant plot.  If pname is
       specified, print to named printer, else use default printer.
    
   :filelist:  A list of alphanumeric files.  This list may contain simple
       filenames, full or relative pathnames, and wildcard characters.  See
       the READ_ command for a complete description.

  ``PLOTALPHA FREE CONTENT Y. DIR CURRENT``

DESCRIPTION
-----------
   All commands in SAC work on the data that is currently in memory.  This
   data in memory is analogous to the temporary or working files used by a text
   editor.  The READ_ command reads binary SAC data files into memory.  This
   command can be used to read a wide variety of alphanumeric data files into
   memory.  These files can be in a fixed format or in free format.  They may
   contain evenly or unevenly spaced data.  They may contain more than one 
   set of data.  There may be only one label and the label is not retained 
   in memory with the data.

   The simplest use of this command is free field input of a Y data set.
   This is also the default.  Free field input of X-Y pairs can be done by 
   simply changing the content option.  By combining the fixed format and 
   content  options, this command can also be used to read very complicated 
   formatted output from other programs directly into SAC.  Multiple Y data 
   sets can be read from the same file using this method.  Only a single X 
   data set is allowed.

   The basic header variables needed for processing are computed.  These
   are NPTS, B, E, DELTA, LEVEN, DEPMIN, DEPMAX, and DEPMIN.  If there is only a
   single Y data set, the name of the data file in memory will be the same as
   that of the alphanumeric disk file.  If there are multiple Y data sets in the
   file, a two digit sequence number is appended to the file name.
   Each line of the alphanumeric data file is read in either free format
   or using the format statement provided.  Each line can be up to 160 
   characters long.  In the case of a free format file, the number of data 
   entries in each line is also determined.  The content field is then used 
   to determine what to do with each of these data entries.  Each specific 
   character in the context field represents a different kind of data 
   element and the order of these characters mimics the order of the data	
   in each line of the file.  The meanings of the allowed characters in the 
   content field are given below:

   :L: Next entry is the label to plot with each data point 
       (only one per data set).
   :Y: Next entry belongs to Y (dependent variable) data set.

   :X: Next entry belongs to X (independent variable) data set.

   :N: Next entry belongs to next Y data set.

   :P: Next pair of entries belong to X and Y data sets.

   :R: Next pair of entries belong to Y and X data sets.

   :I: Ignore (skip) this data element.

   An optional repetition count may follow any of the above characters.  This
   repetition count is a one or two digit integer and has the same meaning as
   repeating the content character that number of times.  A period (".") is an
   infinite repetition count and means use the last characters meaning to decode
   the remaining data elements in the line.  The period can only appear at the
   end of a content field.

EXAMPLES
--------
  To read and plot X-Y pairs in free format where the first field is the label::

      u:  PLOTALPHA CONTENT LP FILEA

  You can't break an X-Y pair between lines in the file.
