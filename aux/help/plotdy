       print to that printer, else use default printer.

DESCRIPTION
-----------
  This command allows you to plot a data set with error bars.  The first
  data file you select (either by name or number) is plotted along the y axis.
  The second data file is the dy value.  If a third data file is selected it is
  the positive dy value.

  Assume you have an evenly spaced ascii file that contains two columns
  of numbers. The first is the y-value. The second column is the dy-value.  You
  wish to read these into SAC and plot the data with error bars.::

      u: READALPHA CONTENT YY MYFILE
      u: PLOTDY 1 2
