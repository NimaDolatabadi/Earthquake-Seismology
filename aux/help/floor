FLOOR
+++++

SUMMARY
-------
Puts a minimum value on logarithmically scaled data.

SYNTAX
------

  ``FLOOR {ON|OFF|v}``

INPUT
-----
   :{ON}:  Turn floor option on but don't change value of floor.
    
   :OFF:  Turn floor option off.
    
   :v:  Turn floor option on and change value of floor.
    
DEFAULT VALUES
--------------

  ``FLOOR 1.0E-10``

DESCRIPTION
-----------
   The floor option applies only when logarithmic scaling is being used.  It
   applies to both the x and y axes.  When this option is on, any data values
   less than the floor are set to the floor before plotting.  By using a small
   positive value for the floor, errors in taking logarithms of non-positive
   numbers are avoided.
