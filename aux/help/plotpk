ALTERNATE FORMS
---------------
GMT may be used instead of ABSOLUTE and ZERO may be used instead of RELATIVE.

DEFAULT VALUES

  ``PLOTPK PERPLOT OFF ABSOLUTE REFERENCE OFF MARKALL OFF SAVELOCS OFF``

DESCRIPTION
-----------
   The format of the PLOTPK_ plot is similiar to the PLOT1_ plot.  This plot
   requires a terminal with a cursor.  When the cursor comes on and the bell
   rings, you enter single character responses to perform the various functions.
   Some but not all responses produce graphic output on the screen.  Error and
   output messages are printed at the top of the screen.
   Picks that are currently in the header are automatically displayed on
   the screen.  Output from the various cursor responses can be directed to the
   SAC header, to a alphanumeric pick file if open (see OAPF), to a HYPO pick
   file if open, and to the terminal.
   If you use the SAVELOCS option to save the cursor locations from the L
   cursor option in the blackboard, the following blackboard variables will be
   defined:

   :NLOCS: The number of locations picked during the execution of this command.
           This is initialized to 0 each time PLOTPK_ is invoked and incremented
   	   by 1 each time a cursor location pick is made.

   :XLOCn: The x value for the nth cursor location pick.  This will be the GMT
   	   time of the pick if the reference time fields in the header are 
	   defined. Otherwise, this will be an offset time.

   :YLOCn: The y value for the nth cursor location pick.

   The command  'help plotpktable' lists valid cursor options for plotpk

HEADER CHANGES
--------------
   Depending upon user responses any of A, KA, F, KF, Tn, KTn.

ERROR MESSAGES
--------------
- 1301: No data files read in.
- 1202: Maximum number of vars sections exceeded:


WARNING MESSAGES
----------------
- 1502: Bad cursor position.  Please retry.

  - cursor is positioned outside of the plot window.  
  - occasionally the Tektronix sends the wrong position to SAC.  Move the 
    cursor a little and retry.

- 1503: Invalid character.  Please retry.

  - A character was input that SAC didn't recognize as a legal response.

- 1905: Need an integer.  Retry.

  - Didn't input an integer following the T response.

- 1906: Need an integer in the range 0 to 4.  Retry.

  - Didn't input a 0, 1, 2 or 3 after a Q response.

- 1907: HYPO line already written.
- 1908: HYPO pick file not open.
- 1909: Can't compute waveform.

  - Adjust cursor position and retry.  Plot is always in ABSOLUTE mode.
