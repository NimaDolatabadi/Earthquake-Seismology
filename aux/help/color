DESCRIPTION
-----------
  This command controls color attributes for those devices which can
  display a large number of colors.  The data color is the color that is used
  when plotting the data files.  The data color may be automatically incremented
  from a color list after each data file is plotted.  The skeleton color is the
  color used to plot and label the axes, titles, grids, and frame ids.  The
  backgound color is the color of an empty frame, before any lines or text are
  plotted.

  Most of the time you will select the name of a standard color, such as
  red or blue.  This will be the color, independent of the selected graphics
  device.  At times, however, you may want to choose a non-standard color, such
  as aquamarine.  This can be done by "downloading" a color table to the
  graphics device.  This color table associates a specific hue, saturation, and
  lightness with a specific integer number.  You can then select aquamarine for
  a particular part of the plot by setting that attribute to the correct number
  from the color table.  This may sound like a lot of work, but if aquamarine is
  your favorite color, it may be worth it.

  If you are plotting several data files on the same plot, you may want
  each to be in a different color.  This is done using the INCREMENT option.
  When this option is on, the data color is incremented from a list of colors
  each time a data file is plotted.  The order of colors in the standard or
  default color list is given below::

    RED, GREEN, BLUE, YELLOW, CYAN, MAGENTA, BLACK

  You may change the order or content of this color list using the LIST option.
  This is useful if you are doing a series of overlay plots (see PLOT2) and
  want the same colors used in the same order on each plot.

EXAMPLES
--------
  To select an incrementing data color starting with red::

      u:  COLOR RED INCREMENT

  To select red data colors on a white backgound with a blue skeleton::

      u:  COLOR RED BACKGROUND WHITE SKELETON BLUE

  To set up an incrementing data color list of red, white, and blue with an
  aquamarine (!!!) background::

      u:  COLOR RED INCREMENT BACKGROUND 47 LIST RED WHITE BLUE

  The above example assumes that aquamarine is color 47 in the color table for
  the selected graphics device.  Background color is currently being ignored.
