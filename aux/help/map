MAP
+++

SUMMARY
-------
  Generate a GMT (Generic Mapping Tools) map which can include station/event
  symbols topography and station names using all the files in SAC memory
  and an optional event file specified on the command line.  Event symbols
  can be scaled according to magnitude, residual, etc. A variety of projections
  are available.  The result of this command is a postscript file and a screen
  display of that file plus a shell script with the GMT commands that produced
  the plot.

SYNTAX
------

  ``MAP   {MERcator | EQuidistant | AZimuthal_equidistant | ROBinson }``

  ``{WEST minlon} {EAST maxlon} {NORTH maxlat} {SOUTH minlat}``

  ``{MAGnitude | REsidual | RMean_residual}``

  ``{EVentfile filename} {TOPOgraphy} {STANames}``

  ``{MAPSCALE on|off } {PLOTSTATIONS on|off} {PLOTEVENTS on|off}``

  ``{PLOTLEGEND on|off} {LEGENDXY x y} {FILE output-file}``

  **Note** Shorthand notations for keywords are in capital letters.

INPUT OPTIONS
-------------

 :MERCATOR:    Generate a Mercator projection.              [ Default ]
 :EQUIDISTANT: Generate an Equidistant cylindrical projection.  
 	       Linear in latitude and longitude.
 :ROBINSON:    Robinson projection, nice for world map.
 :LAMBERT:     Good for large east-west areas.
 :UTM:         Universal transverse mercator. (unimplemented)

 Distances from center are true.

 The following options allow the user to specify the map region.
 The default is to use the min and max defined by the plotted stations
 and events.

 :WEST:        Define minimum longitude for map window.
 :EAST:        Define maximum longitude for map window.
 :NORTH:       Define maximum latitude for map window.
 :SOUTH:       Define minimum latitude for map window.
 :AUTOLIMITS:  Automatically Determine the Limits           [ Default ]


 The following options allow the user to add locations and annotations to
 the map.

 :STANames:     on | off                                     [ Off ]
 :MAPSCALE:     on | off                                     [ Off ]
 		Plot a Distance Scale on the Map
 :PLOTSTATIONS: on | off                                     [ On  ]
 		Plot all the Stations from seismograms
 :PLOTEVENTS:   on | off                                     [ On  ]
  		Plot all the Events from eventfile and/or seismograms

 The following options allow the user to scale the event symbols.
 The default is a constant symbol size.

 :MAGnitude: Scale event symbols linearly with user0.       [ Off ]
 :REsidual:  Scale event symbols linearly with abs(user0).  [ Off ]
	    Positive values are (+) negatives are (-).
 :RMean_residual: Same as residual except mean is removed   [ Off ]
		 from all the residuals.
 :PLOTLEGEND:  on | off                                     [ On  ]
	      Plot a legend for Earthquake Magnitudes and Residuals 
 :LEGENDXY x y: Absolute Location to Plot the Legend        [ 1,1 ]
	       The location is relative to the lower left corner of the Page
	       Values for x and y are to be in inches.
	       This is a legend for Earthquake Magnitudes and Residuals

 :EVENTFILE:   Specify a free-format ASCII text file containing
	      additional event data. Each line in the file contains
	      data for a single event.  The first two columns of
	      each line must contain latitude and longitude (in
	      degrees), respectively.  The third column is optional
	      and contains symbol size information  (e.g.,
	      magnitudes, depth, travel-time residual, ...).
	      The following is an example of a few lines in an
	      eventfile::

	        38.5    42.5   6.5
	        25.5    37.3   5.5
	        44.2    40.9   5.7

 A TITLE_ can be specified using SAC's TITLE_ command.

 :TOPOgraphy:   on | off                                     [ Off ]
  Setting TOPO on allows the user to add  topography and bathymetry to the
  maps.  The command reads option (1) in grdraster.info, and the data file
  referenced for that option must be installed.  The topography color map
  used is in $SACAUX/ctables/gmt.cpt.  The grid files are written in the
  current directory.


The default output file is gmt.ps. An alternative file name can be specified
using the FILE option.

DEFAULT VALUES
--------------

  ``MAP  MERCATOR TOPO off STAN off FILE gmt.ps PLOTSTATIONS on PLOTEVENTS on``

  ``FUNCTIONAL MODULE: FK Spectrum (fks)``

  A title can be added using ch TITLE "..." before running map.

HEADER DATA
-----------
  Station latitudes (stla) and longitudes (stlo) must be set.  If event
  latitudes (evla) and longitudes (evlo) are set they will be included in
  the map.  If this command is executed after running BBFK_, MAP_  will plot
  a great circle arc path along the back azimuth.

  This version of MAP_  was based on version 4.0 of the Generic
  Mapping Tools software and it assumes that the GMT4.0 software is
  loaded on the user's machine and the executables are in the path.

  The results of each MAP_  command are written to a shell file called
  gmt.csh, in the current directory. The user can modify this file to
  take advantage of GMT options not readily available through SAC.
  Default units are in inches, but can be changed in the shell script.

  The results of each MAP_ command will automatically be displayed.  The
  default program used to create the display is gs (ghostscript).  The user
  can choose an  alternative display tool by setting the SACPSVIEWER
  environmental variable.   The default is::

    setenv SACPSVIEWER "gs -sDEVICE=x11 -q -dNOPROMPT -dTTYPAUSE"

  Possible values for SACPSVIEWER on different platforms may include::

    Linux:    gs, gv, ggv, evince
    Mac/OSX:  open, Preview, gs, gv
    Sun/Solaris:  gs, gv
