PLOTSP
++++++

SUMMARY
-------
Plots spectral data in several different formats.

SYNTAX
------

  ``PLOTSP {type},{mode}``
   where type is one of the following:


  ``ASIS|RLIM|AMPH|RL|IM|AM|PH``

   where mode is one of the following:


  ``LINLIN|LINLOG|LOGLIN|LOGLOG``

INPUT
-----
   :ASIS:  Plot components in their present format.
    
   :RLIM:  Plot real and imaginary components.
    
   :AMPH:  Plot amplitude and phase components.
    
   :RL:  Plot real component only.
    
   :IM:  Plot imaginary component only.
    
   :AM:  Plot amplitude component only.
    
   :PH:  Plot phase component only.
    
   :LINLIN:  Set x-y scaling mode to linear-linear.
    
   :LINLOG:  Set x-y scaling mode to linear-logarithmic.
    
   :LOGLIN:  Set x-y scaling mode to logarithmic-linear.
    
   :LOGLOG:  Set x-y scaling mode to logarithmic-logarithmic.
    
DEFAULT VALUES
--------------

  ``PLOTSP ASIS LOGLOG``

DESCRIPTION
-----------
   SAC data files may contain either time-series data or spectral data.
   Certain fields in the header distinguish between the two formats.  Most plot
   commands (PLOT, PLOT1_, etc.) only plot time-series data.  This command lets
   you plot spectral data.

   You may plot one or both spectral components using this command.  One
   frame is generated for each spectral component plotted.  Other plot formats
   will be added as needed.  You can also select the scaling mode to be used.
   This scaling mode applies only to PLOTSP_.

EXAMPLES
--------
  To get a logarithmic-linear plot of the spectral amplitude of a data file::

      u:  READ FILE1
      u:  FFT
      u:  PLOTSP AM LOGLIN

ERROR MESSAGES
--------------
- 1301: No data files read in.
- 1305: Illegal operation on time series file
