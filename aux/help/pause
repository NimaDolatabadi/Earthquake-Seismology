DESCRIPTION
-----------
   This command lets you temporarily suspend the execution of a SAC macro
   file.  When this command is executed, SAC sends a message to your terminal,
   pauses, and then either waits until you type a carriage return or waits for a
   specified period of time.
   This might be of interest if you wanted to study the output of a
   particular command before allowing the next command in the macro to be
   executed.  It is of particular interest in the preparation of macro files to
   be used in demonstrations and tutorials.  The ECHO_ command is also useful for
   preparing such demonstrations.
