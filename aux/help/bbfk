SUMMARY
-------
Computes the broadband frequency-wavenumber (FK) spectral estimate, using all
files in SAC memory.

SYNTAX
------

  ``BBFK {FILTER} {NORMALIZE} {EPS v} {MLM | PDS}``

  ``{EXP n} {WAVENUMBER v} {SIZE m n} {LEVELS n}``

  ``{DB} {TITLE text} {WRITE {ON | OFF} fname} {SSQ n}``

  ``{PRINT {pname} }``

INPUT
-----
   :FILTER:  Apply the bandpass filter designed in the most recent
       FILTERDESIGN_ command.
    
   :NORMALIZE:  Normalizes the covariance matrix with the Capo method.  A
       good idea if the signals vary much in amplitude among channels.
    
   :EPS v:  Regularization quantity for covariance matrix.  Diagonal
       matrix entries are multiplied by (1.0 + EPS).
    
   :MLM:  Use maximum likelihood method for high-resolution estimate.
    
   :PDS:  Take power density spectra without maximum likelihood method.
    
   :EXP n:  Power to which the wavenumber spectrum will be raised.
    
   :WAVENUMBER v:  Number of waves from which to sample spectral
       estimates.
    
   :SIZE m n:  Size of contour plot in polar mode: m is an even num of
       plot samples in the azimuth direction; n is an even num of plot
       samples in the wavenumber direction (m*n is limited to 40,000).
    
   :LEVELS n:  Number of contour intervals.
    
   :DB:  Log scaling of plot in decibels.
    
   :TITLE	text:  Title used in plot.
    
   :WRITE {ON | OFF} fname:  Whether to compute & write contour data in
       square mode to disk (as a type xyz SAC file). fname is file or path
       name (may be an absolute or relative). If no filename has been
       specified, the default is "BBFK".  ON will reactivate fname most
       recently used. OFF turns writing off.
    
   :SSQ n:  Size of the square (number of samples taken along each margin
       of the square). Maximum allowed is 200.
    
   :PRINT {pname}:  Prints the resulting plot to the printer named in
       pname, or to the default printer if pname is not used.  (This
       makes use of the SGF_ capability.)
    
DEFAULT VALUES
--------------

  ``BBFK EPS .01 PDS EXP 1 WVENUMBER 1.0 SIZE 90 32 LEVELS 11 WRITE OFF SSQ 100``

  ``(SSQ matters only if WRITE has been positively specified).``

DESCRIPTION
-----------
   The BBFK_ command allows the user to compute broadband frequency
   wavenumber
   spectra.  It is based on the work of NAWAB et al., 1985 and many other
   references
   in the seismic and engineering literature.

   FUNCTIONAL MODULE: FK Spectrum (fks)


   HEADER DATA:  The following logic is used to determine how to choose or
   calculate station/event offsets:

   Case 1:  If a reference station is set in KUSER1 and is the same for all
   files, and USER7 and USER8 are set for all files, USER7 and USER8
   are used as offsets.

   Case 2:  If station latitude (STLA) and station longitude (STLO) are set
   for all files, offsets are calculated using these, using the
   first
   file as the reference station.

   Case 3:  If USER7 and USER8 are set for all files, they are used as
   offsets.

   Case 4:  If event latitude (EVLA) and event longitude (EVLO) are set
   for all
   files then these are used to calculate offsets, using the first
   station as the reference station.

   OUTPUT: The polar output is plotted immediately (not retained), the square
   output if requested is written out to disk.  The FK peak, back azimuth and
   wavenumber are written to blackboard variables BBFK_AMP, BBFK_BAZIM and
   BBFK_WVNBR respectively.


   ERROR MESSAGES: Size m or n not an even number.  Offsets X,Y,Z not set in
   USER7,8,9 of headers.  Coefficients produced by FILTERDESIGN_ not found, or
   filter type used was not "BP".


   LIMITATIONS: The maximum number of stations allowed is 100.  The maximum size
   of polar contour plot is m x n = 40,000.  The maximum size of square contour
   output is i = 200.
