SUMMARY
-------
Generates a single-trace single-window plot.

SYNTAX
------

  ``PLOT {PRINT {pname} }``

INPUT
-----
   :PRINT {pname}:  Prints the resulting plot to the printer named in
       pname, or to the default printer if pname is not used.
       (This makes use of the SGF_ capability.)
    
    
DESCRIPTION
-----------
  Each data file is displayed in a separate plot.  The total size of the
  plot is determined by the current viewport (see XVPORT_ and VPORT.) The y axis
  limits for each plot can be scaled to the data file's extrema or they can
  have fixed limits.  See the YLIM_ command for details.  The x axis limits are
  controlled by the XLIM_ command.  A user controllable file identification (see
  FILEID) is generated for each file in the plot.  Time picks can be displayed
  (see PICKS).

  If you are plotting to a graphics terminal or workstation, SAC will
  pause between each plot to give you an opportunity to examine the plot.  It
  will type "Waiting" in the text area and wait for your response.  You can type
  a carriage-return to see the next plot, the keyword "go" (or "g") to plot the
  remainder of the files without pausing, or the keyword "kill" (or "k") to not
  plot the remainder of the files at all.
