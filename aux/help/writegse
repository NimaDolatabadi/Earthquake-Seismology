WRITEGSE
++++++++

SUMMARY
-------
Write data files in GSE 2.0 format from memory to disk.

SYNTAX
------

  ``WRITEGSE {TYPE} {SOURCE ON|OFF|str} {COMMIT|ROLLBACK|RECALLTRACE} {DIR name} filename``

INPUT
-----
   :TYPE:  Determines wether the data are written in ascii integer format
       (INT) or as compressed gse format (CM6). Default is INT.
    
   :SOURCE str:  str is a string 20 characters or less specifying the
       institution at which the GSE file was written.  str is
       written in the MSG_ID line of the resultant GSE file.
    
   :COMMIT_:   Commits headers and waveforms in SAC memory -- removing any
       previous versions of headers or waveforms from RAM -- prior
       to reading more files.  COMMIT is the default.
    
   :ROLLBACK_:  Reverts to the last committed version of the header and
       waveform before reading more files.
    
   :RECALLTRACE_:

       - reverts to the last committed version of the waveform,
       - reverts to the last committed version of those header
         variables closely linked to the waveform,
       - commits those header variables which are loosely linked
         to the waveform. (see RECALLTRACE_ for a list of which 
	 header variables are committed, and which are rolled back.)

   :DIR name:  The directory in which to write the gsefile.  This directory
       name is the same one that is used in WRITE_ command.

   :filename: The name of the gse file to be written.

DEFAULT VALUES
--------------

  ``WRITEGSE INT SOURCE OFF COMMIT``

DESCRIPTION
-----------
  Writes all data in memory to a single file according to the GSE 2.0 data format

  The following GSE Data messages are written:
   - WAVEFORM
   - STATION
   - CHANNEL
   - ARRIVAL
   - ORIGIN

  Waveforms are written in INT format:  floating point data is truncated to the
  nearest integer.

  **Note**  There is no way in GSE 2.0 to associate ORIGIN data with a 
  waveform, so SAC's READGSE_ command does not read ORIGIN data, but 
  WRITEGSE_ writes it.

  **Note**  SAC does not currently read nor write DETECTIONS information.  
  Therefore, ARRIVAL information is not associated with specific channels.
