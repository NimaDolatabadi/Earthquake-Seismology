DESCRIPTION
-----------
  This command produces a diagnostic plot which may be used to select
  the order of the MEM spectral estimate.  The plot is of the normalized
  prediction error function, displayed as a function of the order of the
  estimator.  Typically, the prediction error is large for small orders,
  but decreases rapidly as the order is increased.  The prediction error
  is the "residual power" left after the prediction filter is applied to
  the data.  When this quantity is small, so the theory goes, most of
  the structure in the spectrum has been captured in the power frequency
  response of the filter.  The residual data is white noise.  Consequently,
  one may examine the prediction error function for "knees" in the
  curve, where the function drops dramatically to some value that is not
  reduced much further by further increases in order.  The order of the
  predictor at the "knee" is often used as the order of the MEM_ spectral
  estimator.
