DESCRIPTION
-----------
   This command implements the Maximum Likelihood Method estimator
   for the power density spectrum.
   This estimator generates a spectral estimate which represents the
   power outputs of a bank of narrow band-pass filters which have been
   optimized to reject out-of-band power.  The result is a smoothed, parametric
   estimate of the power density spectrum.  The parameters are the coefficients
   of the (finite impulse response) narrowband filters.  The user can choose the
   number of parameters.  The filters are not actually computed by the
   algorithm, which accounts for the speed of the method.
    
   The method is desirable because it generally has better resolution
   than the conventional method, and much better sidelobe reduction.
   The order of the algorithm is limited to 100, since it requires
   the inversion of a matrix with dimension equal to the order.  A fast
   method exists for the inversion, but numerical noise can be a problem
   for large order estimates.
    
   Documentation for this method can be found in the paper by Richard Lacoss
   in the IEEE book "Modern Spectrum Analysis" by Donald Childers.
