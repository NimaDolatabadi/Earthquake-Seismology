WRITECOR
++++++++

SUMMARY
-------
Writes a SAC file containing the correlation function.

SYNTAX
------

  `` [W]RITE[COR] {file} ``

INPUT
-----
  :file:     The name of the SAC file to write.

DEFAULT VALUES
--------------
 
  `` WRITECOR COR ``

DESCRIPTION
-----------
  The structure of the correlation function written out by this command
  is determined by the algorithm used to compute it.  Since the data
  is partitioned into windows, and sample correlation functions are calculated
  from each window, then averaged, the length of the correlation function
  is determined by the data window size.  It contains exactly one less
  sample than twice the number of samples in the data window.  However,
  since FFT's are used to calculate the sample correlation functions,
  the number of points in the file is a power of two.  It is, in fact,
  the first power of two larger than the data window size (in samples).
  The additional samples are zero.  The correlation function is also circularly
  rotated within the file, due to the pecularities of  computing correlations
  with the FFT_ algorithm.  This means that the zero-lag sample is the first
  sample in the file, and the negative-lag samples follow the positive-lag
  samples.

ERROR MESSAGES
--------------
 - 5003: No correlation function calculated.
