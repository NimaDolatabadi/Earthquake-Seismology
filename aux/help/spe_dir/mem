SUMMARY
-------
Calculates the spectral estimate using the Maximum Entropy Method.

SYNTAX:

   ``MEM {[O]RDER n}, {[N]UMBER n}``

INPUT
-----
   :ORDER n:   Set the order of the prediction error filter in lags to n.
   :NUMBER n:   Set the number of points to be used in the spectral estimate.
       
DEFAULT VALUES
--------------
  
  `` MEM ORDER 25``
    
DESCRIPTION
-----------
  This command implements the Maximum Entropy Method estimator.
  This estimator is a parametric method, which uses a prediction
  error filter to whiten the data.  The resulting spectral estimate
  is proportional to the inverse of the filter's power frequency
  response.  The user is free to choose the order of the prediction error
  filter.  See the documentation of the PPE_ command for further details.

  The principal advantage of this method is the very high resolution that
  it can achieve with a relatively small amount of data.  Its disadvantage
  is that less can be said about it theoretically than about the conventional
  method.

  Documentation for this method can be found in the review paper
  on linear prediction by John Makhoul in "Modern Spectrum Analysis."
  The formal name of the actual method implemented is the Yule-Walker
  method.
