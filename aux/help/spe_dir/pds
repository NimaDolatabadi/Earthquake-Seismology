DESCRIPTION
-----------
  This command implements the "conventional" spectral estimator.  It is
  the simplest  the sample correlation function is first windowed with
  a correlation window, and the resulting function is transformed with
  an FFT_ to obtain the spectral estimate.  As mentioned in the documentation
  on the COR_ command, there is a tradeoff between the bias of the estimate,
  primarily expressed in loss of resolution, and the variance of the
  estimate.  As the window is made longer, the bias is reduced, since
  frequency-domain resolution is increased.  However, the variance of
  the spectral estimate is increased, since the variance of the
  sample correlation function values is larger at larger lags.  This occurs
  because fewer data points are used to estimate the values at larger lags.
    
  The choice of correlation window type has a different effect than
  that of the choice of data window described in the COR_ documentation.
  It is a choice between two types of bias.
    
  The spectral estimate approaches the convolution of the true spectrum
  with the Fourier transform of the correlation window.  The window
  transform is characterized by a central lobe, which controls resolution,
  and sidelobes, which cause out-of-band power leakage.
  Typically one wants a narrow main lobe and small sidelobes.
  Large sidelobes tend to put an artificial, high regular "floor" on
  the spectral estimate, that can mask the rolloff of a spectrum with
  high dynamic range.
  The choice of window type trades off main lobe resolution against
  power-leakage through the sidelobes.
    
  The rectangular window has the narrowest main lobe, and, therefore,
  the best resolution.  However, it has the largest sidelobes.  The
  cosine taper window reduces the sidelobes slightly without affecting
  the main lobe width much.  These two windows were primarily included for
  estimating the spectra of transients, which requires little time-domain
  distortion.  The Hamming and Hanning windows are popular windows
  which have small sidelobes and rather wide main lobes.  They
  are useful when the user has a lot of data, and can control
  resolution by increasing the window size.  Both are raised cosine
  windows, but the Hamming window is optimized to minimize the size
  of the largest sidelobe.  It is generally to be prefered, and is the
  default window in this command.  The triangular window also has rather good
  sidelobe structure, but has the especially desirable property that
  it guarantees that the spectral estimate will always be positive
  or zero.
    
  Generally, PDS is to be prefered over the two parametric methods,
  MLM_ and MEM_, when the user has a large data set available.  This is
  because resolution is not constrained in that situation, and much
  more is known about this estimator than is known about the others.
  For example, the theory is available which allows us to estimate
  confidence limits, and the resolution of the method.  Both of these
  diagnostics are included in SPE_.  The parametric methods generally exhibit
  better resolution than PDS, especially when estimating line spectra,
  and are more useful when a limited amount of data is available.
