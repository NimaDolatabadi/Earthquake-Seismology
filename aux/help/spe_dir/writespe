WRITESPE
++++++++

SUMMARY
-------
Writes a SAC file containing the spectral estimate.

SYNTAX

  `` [W]RITE[SPE] {file}``

INPUT
-----

   :file:     The name of the SAC file to write.

DEFAULT VALUES
--------------

  `` WRITESPE SPE_ ``


DESCRIPTION
-----------
  The spectral estimate file contains the spectral estimate from
  zero up to the folding frequency.
  The spectral estimate is calculated with an FFT_.
  The number of points in this file is half the length of the FFT_ used
  plus one.

  This format was chosen so that multiple spectra computed with SPE_ could
  be compared using the P2 plotting function, without any need to cut the
  files prior to plotting.

ERROR MESSAGES
--------------
 -  5004: No spectral estimate calculated.
