READCOR
+++++++

SUMMARY
-------
Reads data from a SAC data file into memory.

SYNTAX
------

   ``READCOR file``

INPUT
-----

  :file:   A legal filename.

DESCRIPTION
-----------
  This command works just like the READ_ command in the main SAC program
  with two exceptions.

  First, only ONE file may be read in while in SPE_.
  Second, executing this command deletes any correlation function or
  spectral estimate that may already have been computed.
  Parameters within SPE_, such as the number of prewhitening coefficients
  or the window type and length, are not changed when this command
  is executed.

  To reinitialize all SPE_ parameters, terminate the subprocess using
  the QUITSUB_ command and then start it over again.
