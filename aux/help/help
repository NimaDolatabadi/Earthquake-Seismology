HELP
++++

SUMMARY
-------
Displays information about SAC commands and features on the screen.

SYNTAX
------

  ``HELP {item ...}``

INPUT
-----
   :item:  The (full or abbreviated) name of a command, module,
       subprocess, feature, etc.
    
DEFAULT VALUES
--------------

  ``If no item is requested, an introductory help package is displayed.``

DESCRIPTION
-----------
  Each requested item in the help package is displayed in the order they
  are requested.  A short message is displayed if no information is available for
  an item.  After a full page of output, the user is prompted to see if he or
  she wishes to see more information on that item.  A response of "NO" or "N"
  will terminate the display of that item and will begin the display of the
  next item if any.  A response of "QUIT" or "Q" will terminate the display of
  all items.  The help package for each command consists of the entry in the SAC
  Command Reference Manual.  The help package for non-commands may be paragraphs
  from the SAC Users Manual or other information.

EXAMPLES
--------
  To get the introductory help package type::

      u:  HELP

  Now lets say you want information on several commands::

      u:  HELP READ CUT BEGINDEVICE PLOT

  SAC begins displaying the READ_ help package.  After a full page, it asks if
  you've seen enough::

      s:  MORE?
      u:  YES
   
  SAC displays the rest of the help package on READ_, and then begins 
  displaying the help package on the CUT_ command::

      s:  MORE?
      u:  NO

  SAC stops displaying the CUT_ help package and begins displaying the 
  BEGINDEVICE help package::

      s:  MORE?
      u:  QUIT

  You're getting impatient so you type QUIT_.  SAC terminates the HELP_ 
  command so you can try some of the features discussed.

ERROR MESSAGES
--------------
- 1103: No help package is available.

  - SAC can't find the help package.  Check your SACAUX environment.
