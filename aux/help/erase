Erases the graphics display area.

SYNTAX

  ``ERASE``

DESCRIPTION
-----------
   This command works only if SAC knows what graphics device you are using.
   This is true only if you have already done some plotting.
   This command is necessary for the ADM terminal which does not have an
   erase screen key and is useful in command files when you want the screen
   erased prior to sending out a large amount of text.
