SORT
++++

SUMMARY
-------
Sorts files in memory by header fields.

SYNTAX
------

  ``SORT COMMIT|ROLLBACK|RECALLTRACE``

  ``header {ASCEND|DESCEND} {header {ASCEND|DESCEND} ... }``

INPUT
-----
   :COMMIT:  Commits headers and waveforms in SAC memory -- removing any
       previous versions of headers or waveforms from RAM -- prior
       to writing files.  COMMIT is the default.
    
   :ROLLBACK:  reverts to the last committed version of the header and
       waveform before writing files.

   :RECALLTRACE_: 

     - reverts to the last committed version of the waveform,
     - reverts to the last committed version of those header
       variables closely linked to the waveform,
     - commits those header variables which are loosely linked
       to the waveform. (RECALLTRACE_ for a list of which 
       header variables are committed, and which are rolled back.)

   :HEADER:  header field upon which to sort the files.

   :ASCEND:  Sort files on header in ascending order. This is the default.

   :DESCEND: Sort files on header in descending order


DESCRIPTION
-----------
   Sort the files in memory in order according to the header field given.
   The earlier a header field appears on the command line, the higher priority
   that field will receive in the sort, the first field receiving the highest
   priority, and subsequent fields used to break ties.  No more than five
   header fields may be entered.  Each may be followed by either ASCEND or
   DESCEND to indicate the direction of the sort on that particular field.
   If neither ASCEND nor DESCEND is specified, ASCEND will be used by default.
   If Sort is called without specifying any header fields, it will sort on
   the fields specified in the previous call to SORT_.  If the first call to
   SORT_ is without any header fields, it will produce error 1379.


DEFAULTS
--------
It is presumed that all sorts will be in ascending order unless DESCEND
is specified on the command line.
