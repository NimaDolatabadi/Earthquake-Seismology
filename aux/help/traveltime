TRAVELTIME
++++++++++

SUMMARY
-------
Computes traveltime of selected phases for pre-defined velocity models.
This version of TRAVELTIME is not within SSS_,  To get the SSS version, go to SSSTRAVELTIME_.   


SYNTAX
------
::

   [T]RAVEL[TIME] {MODEL string} {PICKS number} {PHASE phase list}  {VERBOSE | QUIET} {M |KM}
    
INPUT
-----

   :MODEL: iasp91 [default], ak135

   :Picks: There are a total of 10 time picks in the SAC header: t0 to t9.  If the number is 
      n (0<=n<=9), the first phase will be at Tn. If PICKS is not included among the 
      command-line options, VERBOSE will be turned on and the phase arrival times will be 
      displayed but will not be put in the header.

   :PHASE: List of phases for which times are picked and displayed. If PICKS n is among the
      options, the phase arrivala times and their labels will be added to the header starting
      at Tn.  If n is 0, one can have up to 10 phases, if n is 8, one can have no more than 2.
      
   :VERBOSE | QUIET:  If VERBOSE is among the options in the TRAVELTIME command line, phase
       arrival times are displayed relative to both the origin time (O) and to the
       first-point time (B).  If QUIET is among the options in the TRAVELTIME command line,
       VERBOSE is turned off (if it was on) and nothing is displayed on the screen.  If
       neither has been displayed, the depth used by TRAVELTIME is displayed.

   :M | KM:  If M is among the options in the command line, SAC interprets EVDP as being in 
       meters.  If KM is displayed, EVDP is interpreted as being in kilometers.
   
   :DEFAULT VALUES: MODEL iasp91 KM PHASE P S Pn Pg Sn Sg

DESCRIPTION
-----------
   All waeforms in memory must have event and station locations defined as well as
   the origin time.
   
   This command calculates traveltimes using the iaspei-tau procedures developed
   for models iasp91 or ak135. For more information on this package, go to the iaspei-tau 
   link at URL <https://seiscode.iris.washington.edu/projects/iaspei-tau/>.
   The phase picks are stored in the SAC header for all files in memory in header
   variables Tn, where n is in the range 0 to 9. The times are calculated relative to 
   the origin time (O) but the Tn times are relative to the first-point time (B). 
   
   The traveltime tables used to calculate the stored degree-distance measure (GCARC).
   (GCARC is calculated from the event and station latitude and longitudes using
   spherical-triangle geometry after converting geographic latitudes to geocentric.)
   
   For historical reason, the units for EVDP were meters, and SAC waveforms proudced by 
   RDSEED have EVDP in meters.  In v101.5, the default for EVDP is kilometers, but as 
   many waveforms have EVDP in meters, we introduced the command option M which if 
   set to ON means the input EVDP for all files in memory have EVDP inmeters.
   In the final example, the SAC files had been extracted from a SEED vlume using RDSEED
   for a version prior to v5.2, so EVDEP is in meters,  (Starting with v5.2, the depth in 
   RDSEED is in kilometers.)
   
   In SAC2000 (the most recent releae in which TRAVELTIME was functional) , TRAVELTIME was 
   in the Signal Stacking Subprocess (SSS_).  The current version (V101.5) does not have all
   the capabilities of the SAC2000 version and can run without going into SSS.  
   See SSSTRAVELTIME_ for the syntax in SSS.
   
EXAMPLES
--------
  
  A regional event using the default phases::
   
     SAC> fg seismo
     SAC>  traveltime 
     traveltime: depth: 15.000000
     traveltime: error finding phase P       
     traveltime: error finding phase S       
     traveltime: setting phase Pn       at 10.464321 s [ t = 51.894321 s ]
     traveltime: setting phase Pg       at 22.904724 s [ t = 64.334724 s ]
     traveltime: setting phase Sn       at 50.047722 s [ t = 91.477722 s ]
     traveltime: setting phase Sg       at 66.414337 s [ t = 107.844337 s ]
     SAC> 

  For regional events the first arrivals are Pn or Pg, so by the convention used here
  there is no "P" arival.  For the above example, no picks are added to the header.:: 
  
     SAC> fg seismo
     SAC>  traveltime picks 0 phase Pn Pg Sn Sg
     traveltime: depth: 15.000000
     SAC> lh AMARKER T0MARKER T1MARKER T2MARKER T3MARKER
     AMARKER = 10.464                        T0MARKER = 10.464           (Pn)
     T1MARKER = 22.905           (Pg)        T2MARKER = 50.048           (Sn)
     T3MARKER = 66.414           (Sg)
     SAC> write seismo-picks.z
     SAC>
  
  We see that the already defined A is at Pn.  The file written to seismo-picks.z will
  have T0 through T3 in the header, and a call to PLOT1_ will show labeled vertical lines 
  at the calculated times.
  
  Note that even though VERBOSE was not turned on, the depth (in km) used is printed out.
  This is a safeguard to assure that one has made the correct assumption about the EVDP 
  units.  The printing of traveltime depth can be suppressed by entering QUIET on the 
  command line.
  
  The header for the waveform in the following example was produced by RDSEED (V5.0) and
  EVDP is in meters::
  
     SAC> r 2008.052.14.16.03.0000.XC.OR075.00.LHZ.M.SAC
     SAC> lh evdp
     evdp = 6.700000e+03
     SAC> traveltime M picks 0
     traveltime: depth: 6.700000 km
     SAC> lh t0marker t1marker t2marker t3marker
     t0marker = 61.48            (Pn)        t1marker = 76.413           (Pg)
     t2marker = 109.66           (Sn)        t3marker = 132.11           (Sg)
     SAC> ch evdp (0.001 * &1,evdp&)
     SAC> setbb station &1,KSTNM&
     SAC> write %station%.z
     SAC>
     
The saved file, OR075.z, will have evdp in kilometers and annotated picks at the times 
for Pn, Pg, Sn, and Sg.  (One could have done the chnhdr command before calling TRAVELTME 
and then not entered M on the command line.)  
   
Phase names are case sensitive.  See the iaspei-tau documentation.
