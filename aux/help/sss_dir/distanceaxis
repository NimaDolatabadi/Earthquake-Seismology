DISTANCEAXIS
++++++++++++

SUMMARY
-------
Define the record section plot distance axis parameters.

SYNTAX
------
   `` [D]ISTANCE[A]XIS FIXED v|SCALED v``

INPUT
-----
    :FIXED v:       Force axis length to be $v$ cm long.
    :SCALED v:      Allow the axis length to be scaled to the data.
        The axis length (in cm) will be the range of the axis
        (in km.) divided by v.
    
DEFAULTS VALUES
---------------

   ``DISTANCEAXIS FIXED 35``
    
DESCRIPTION
-----------
   This command defines the properties of the distance axis for subsequent
   record section plots (see  PLOTRECORDSECTION.)
   The length of the axis can be a fixed size or it can be scaled to the
   range of the axis variable (distance in this case.)
   The TIMEAXIS command controls the time axis properties.
  
EXAMPLES
--------
  If you entered the following command::
    
      u:  DISTANCEAXIS SCALED 2.0

  and the minimum and maximum distances in the data set being plotted are
  150 and 300 km respectively, the distance axis would be 75 cm long.
    
KNOWN BUGS
----------
  The y to x aspect ratio defined by this command and by the  TIMEAXIS
  command is correct on plots to any device.
  The physical size requested is ignored when plotting to an interactive
  device (e.g. TERMINAL, XWINDOWS)

  If the SGF_ device is requested, the physical size is stored in these files.
  The current SGF_ plot programs do not have the capability to make arbitrary
  sized plots (i.e. panelling).  This panelling option is planned for a
  future release.
