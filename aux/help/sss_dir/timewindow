INPUT
-----
    :v1 v2:  The time window limits to use when reading in files
       before doing a stack summation.

DEFAULT VALUES
--------------
   None.  You MUST specify a time window before doing a summation

DESCRIPTION
-----------
  This command sets the stack time window.  This is the time window that will 
  be used in subsequent SUMSTACK_ PLOTSTACK_, and  PLOTRECORDSECTION_ 
  commands. The stack time window must be defined before any of these commands
  are executed.  If a particular file does not fall entirely within this stack
  time window enough zeros are added before or after the actual data to make 
  up the difference.
