SUMMARY
-------
Sets global stack properties.

SYNTAX
------

   ``[G]LOBAL[S]TACK property [property ...]``

    where property is one or more of the following:
  
    ``[W]EIGHT v``
    ``[DI]STANCE v``
    ``[DE]LAY v [[S]ECONDS|[P]OINTS]``
    ``[I]NCREMENT v [[s]ECONDS|[P]OINTS]``
    ``[N]ORMAL``
    ``[R]EVERSED``

INPUT
-----
    :[W]EIGHT v:     Global weighting factor in the range
       zero to one.

    :[DI]STANCE v:   Global station to epicenter distance
       in kilometers.

    :[DE]LAY v [[S]ECONDS|[P]OINTA]:   Global static time delay.  This delay is
       in either seconds or number of data points.

    :[I]NCREMENT v [[S]ECONDS|[P]OINTS]:  Global static time delay increment.  
        This increment is in either seconds or number of data points.

    :[N]ORMAL:       Normal global polarity property.

    :[R]EVERSED:     Reversed global polarity property.
    
    
DESCRIPTION
-----------
   This command allows you to define global stack properties.  These global 
   properties are associated with each file as it is added to the stack file 
   list (see ADDSTACK) unless local values are given for that file.  These 
   properties are discussed in more detail in the  ADDSTACK command and an 
   example of the use of this command is given there.
