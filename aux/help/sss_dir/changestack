CHANGESTACK
+++++++++++

SUMMARY
-------
Change properties of files currently in the stack file list.

SYNTAX
------

   ``[C]HANGE[S]TACK filename|filenumber property {property}``
  
   where property is one or more of the following:
 
   ``[W]EIGHT v``
   ``[DI]STANCE v``
   ``[BE]GINTIME v``
   ``[END]TIME v``
   ``[DE]LAY v {S]ECONDS]|[P]OINTS}``
   ``[I]NCREMENT v {[S]ECONDS|[P]OINTS}``
   ``[N]ORMAL``
   ``[R]EVERSED``

INPUT
-----
    :filename:     The name of the file in the stack file list.

    :filenumber:   The number of the file in the stack hfile list.

    :[W]EIGHT  v: Weighting factor for this file in the range zero to one.  
      Each data point is multiplied by this value when the stack is summed.

    :[DI]STANCE v: Station to epicenter distance in kilometers for this file.  
       This is used to calculate dynamic time delays.

    :[BE]GINTIME v: Time of the begining of the event.

    :[END]TIME v: Time of the end of the event.

    :[DE]LAY v {[S]ECONDS|[P]OINTS}: Static time delay to apply to file.
       This delay is in either seconds or number of data points.

    :[I]NCREMENT v {[S]ECONDS|[P]OINTS}: Static time delay increment for this 
       file. This increment is in either seconds or number of data points.  
       The static time delay is incremented by this ammount each time the  
       INCREMENTSTACK command is executed.

    :[N]ORMAL:  File has normal polarity.

    :[R]EVERSED:  File has reversed polarity.  (Each data point in the signal 
       is multiplied by -1.0  when the stack is summed.)
    
DESCRIPTION
-----------
  This command allows you to change any of the properties associated with
  files in the stack file list.  These properties are discussed in more detail 
  in the  ADDSTACK command and an example of the use of this command is given 
  there. This command leaves all other properties for all other files unchanged.
