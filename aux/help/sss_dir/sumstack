  This command sums the files in the stack file list.  A stack time window 
  (see  TIMEWINDOW) must have been defined before this command is executed. 
  Each signal is shifted in accordance with its static and dynamic delays. 
  Zeros are added to the sum for that part of each file that is not in the 
  time window.  Each file is given the requested weighting and files with 
  reversed polarity are inverted.

  A plot of the summation is automatically produced.  The summation can 
  be saved on disk using the WRITESTACK command.
