   ``PRINT {pname}``
          


INPUT
-----
    :LABELS ON | OFF:    Turn the file labeling option on or off.  When
       this option is on, each file is labeled with header field.

    :LABELS headerfield:    Turn the file labeling option on and set the
       name of the header field.

    :ORIGIN DEFAULT | REVERSED:  In portrait mode, distance is along the y 
       axis and default puts the distance origin at the top left corner.  In 
       landscape mode, distance is along the x axis and default puts the 
       distance origin at the bottom left corner. 

    :REFERENCELINE ON | OFF:    Turn reference line option on or off.  When 
       this option is on, a vertical dotted line is drawn at the distance 
       property value for each file.

    :SIZE v:

    :WEIGHT ON | OFF:     Turn the file weighting option on or off.

    :POLARITY ON | OFF:   Turn the file polarity option on or off.

    :CURSOR ON | OFF:     See below.

    :REDUCED ON | OFF | VELOCITY number | PHASE name:  Reduced travel time 
       curves can be computed relative to a specific velocity or a phase from 
       the traveltime curves.  See SSSTRAVELTIME_.

    :ORIENT portrait | landscape: In portrait mode, horizontal axis indicates 
       time and the vertical axis indicates event to station distance.  In 
       landscape mode, the horizontal axis indicates the event to station 
       distance and time is along the vertical axis.  

    :TTIME ON | OFF | DEFAULT | TEXT: Turn traveltime curves on.  Traveltime 
       curves must have been computed with the traveltime command.  

    :XLABEL ON | OFF | DEFAULT | TEXT: Turn xlabel on and/or set xlabel text.  

    :YLABEL ON | OFF | DEFAULT | TEXT: Turn ylabel on and/or set ylabel text.  

    :PRINT {pname}:  Print the resultant plot.  If pname is specified, print 
       to named printer, else use default printer.

DEFAULT VALUES
--------------

    ``PLOTRECORDSECTION LABELS filename ORIGIN default REFERENCELINE on ``
    ``SIZE 0.1 WEIGHT on POLARITY on ORIENT portrait REDUCED off ``
    ``CURSOR off TTIME off``


DESCRIPTION
-----------
  This command plots the files in the stack file list in a record section 
  format.  The effect of a particular velocity model can easily be seen with 
  this plot.  In portrait mode, the x axis is time, the y axis is epicentral 
  distance.  Landscape mode reverses these axes.  The zero amplitude of each 
  file is plotted at its epicentral distance along the distance axis.  A 
  distance must be defined for all files in the stack file list for this plot   
  to be generated.  The distance can come from the header or it can be defined 
  in the DISTANCE option of the  GLOBALSTACK,  ADDSTACK, or  CHANGESTACK 
  command.  The  DISTANCEWINDOW and  TIMEWINDOW commands control how much data 
  will be displayed.  The  DISTANCEAXIS and  TIMEAXIS commands control the 
  size of each axis and thus the aspect ratio of the complete plot.  Dynamic 
  delays are controlled by the use of the  VELOCITYMODEL command.  A line 
  showing the effects of a second velocity model is also controlled by the  
  VELOCITYMODEL command.  A velocity rosette showing the effects of other 
  velocities can be placed on this plot. It is controlled by the  
  VELOCITYROSET command.  Static delays if they have been defined are also 
  applied to each of the signals.

CURSOR ON MODE
--------------
  In cursor on mode two additional functionalities are available:  zooming and
  apparent velocity determination. 
  The zoom capability requires the user to specify where to crop the picture.
  The user does this by moving the cursor to one corner of the desired display
  area and typing c1 (no mouse click is needed) and moving the cursor to the 
  opposite corner and typing c2.  When the user types c2, plotrecordsection 
  replots the data including only those data files which lie within the distance
  window, and cutting off all the data points which fall outside the time window. 
 
  The user can type o (the letter 'o') to replot the original.  Zoomed plots can
  be nested to five levels (ie, you can zoom a previously zoomed plot, 
  entering o causes prs to unzoom one level and replot).  The cursor on option 
  also allows the user to measure apparent velocity by moving the cursor and 
  typing v1 and v2 to mark the points.  Once the v2 is selected, the apparent
  velocity is printed on the output device and stored in a blackboard 
  variable, vapp.  Multiple v2 values can be set but only the latest will be 
  stored in the blackboard variable.  While the cursor is on, the available 
  commands in the plot window are c1, c2, v1, v2, and q which quits cursor on 
  (q returns control to the sss subprocess).
