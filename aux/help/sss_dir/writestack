SYNTAX

  ``[W]RITE[S]TACK {COMMIT|ROLLBACK|RECALLTRACE} [filename]``

INPUT
-----
   :COMMIT:  Commits headers and waveforms in SAC memory -- removing any
       previous versions of headers or waveforms from RAM -- prior
       to writing files.  COMMIT is the default.
    
   :ROLLBACK:  reverts to the last committed version of the header and
       waveform before writing files.
    
   :RECALLTRACE:  

     - reverts to the last committed version of the waveform
     - reverts to the last committed version of those header variables 
       closely linked to the waveform,
     - commits those header variables which are loosely linked to the 
       waveform. (use HELP_ RECALLTRACE for a list of which header 
       variables are committed, and which are rolled back.)

   :filename:  The name of the disk file into which the summation is to 
       be written.
