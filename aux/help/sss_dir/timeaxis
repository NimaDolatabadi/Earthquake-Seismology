TIMEAXIS
++++++++

SUMMARY
-------
Controls the time axis properties on subsequent record section plots.

SYNTAX
------
  
   ``[T]IME[A]XIX [F]IXED v|[S]CALED v``

INPUT
-----
   :FIXED v:        Fix the length of the time axis in cm to v.

   :SCALED v:       Scale the length of the time axis in cm to be
       v times the total time window.

DEFAULTS VALUES
---------------

   ``TIMEAXIS FIXED 23.0``

EXAMPLES
--------
  If you are making several record setion plots with different time
  windows and you want each 2 seconds on these plots to be 1 cm long:

    u:  TIMEAXIS SCALED 0.5

KNOWN BUGS
----------
  The y and x aspect ration defined by this command and by the
  DISTANCEAXIS command is correct onplots to any device.  The physical
  size requested is ignored when plotting to an interactive device
  (e.g. TERMINAL, XWINDOWS)  If the SGF device is requested, the
  physical size is stored in these files.  The current SGF plot programs do
  not have the capability to make arbitrary sized plots (i.e. panelling).
  This panelling option is planned for a future release.
