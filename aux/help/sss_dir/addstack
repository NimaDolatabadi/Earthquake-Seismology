SUMMARY
-------
Add a new file to the stack file list.

SYNTAX
------

   ``[A]DD[S]TACK filename [property ...]``

    where property is one or more of the following:
 
    :TRUST ON|OFF:
    :[W]EIGHT v:
    :[DI]STANCE v:
    :[BE]GINTIME v:
    :[END]TIME v:
    :[DE]LAY v [[S]ECONDS|[P]OINTS]:
    :[I]NCREMENT v [[S]ECONDS|[P]OINTS]:
    :[N]ORMAL:
    :[R]EVERSE:

INPUT
-----
       :filename:      Name of the file to be added to the stack file list.

       :TRUST ON|OFF:  This option is used to resolve an ambiguity
         in converting files from SAC to CSS format. When converting the 
         data, matching event IDs could mean the files have identical event
         information, or they could be an artifact of the merging of these 
         two very different formats.  
         
         When TRUST is ON, SAC is more likely to accept matching event IDs
         as  identical event information than when TRUST is OFF, depending 
         on the history of READ_ commands associated with the current data
         files in memory.

       :[W]EIGHT v:  Weighting factor for this file in the range zero to one.
         Each data point is multiplied by this value when the stack is summed.

       :[DI]STANCE v:  Station to epicenter distance in kilometers for this 
          file.  This is used to calculate dynamic time delays.

       :[BE]GINTIME v:  Time of the begining of the event.

       :[END]TIME v:  Time of the end of the event.

       :[DE]LAY v [[S]ECONDS|[P]OINTS]: Static time delay to apply to file.
          This delay is in either seconds or number of data points.

       :[I]NCREMENT v [[S]ECONDS|[P]OINTS]: Static time delay increment for 
           this file. This increment is in either seconds or number of data 
           points.  The static time delay is incremented by this ammount each 
           time the incrementstack command is executed.

       :[N]ORMAL: File has normal polarity.

       :[R]EVERSED: File has reversed polarity. (Each data point in the 
           signal is multiplied   by -1.0 when the stack is summed.)
    
DEFAULTS VALUES
---------------
   Each file is given the global property value if no local
   one is entered.  The default units for the DELAY and
   INCREMENT options is SECONDS.
    
DESCRIPTION
-----------
 There are seven properties associated with each stack list file.  They are

   - the weighting factor.
   - the station to epicenter distance.
   - the begin time of the event.
   - the end time of the event.
   - the static time delay in either seconds or number of data points.
   - the static time delay increment in either seconds or number of data points
   - the polarity of the file, either normal or reversed.
    
   There is a global value associated with each of these properties.
   They are defined by the globalstack command.
   When a file is added to the stack file list, that file's properties
   will be set to the global value if no local value is given.
   The changestack command can be used to change a file's
   properties after it has been added to the stack file list.
    
   All commands which load data into memory have are now monitored to maintain
   a level of confidence in the event information when moved from the SAC data
   buffer to the CSS data buffer.  For ADDSTACK, when the confidence is HIGH 
   that all the data files are cosistent in the numbering of event IDs, matching
   event IDs are treated as having identical event information.  When the
   confidence is LOW in ADDSTACK, matching event IDs are understood as an 
   artifact, and new event IDs are generated for the incoming file.
   For more details use HELP_ READ_.
    
    
EXAMPLES
--------
 The following examples illustrate several of the features of the
 Signal Stacking Module.  Suppose you entered the following set of commands::
    
      u:  GLOBALSTACK DELAY 1.0 INCREMENT 0.03
      :u:  ADDSTACK FILEA DELAY 2.0
      :u:  ADDSTACK FILEB DELAY 3.0 INCREMENT 0.01 REVERSED
      :u:  ADDSTACK FILEC
      :u:  ADDSTACK FILED WEIGHT 0.5

  The first command changes the global property values for time delay and
  time delay increment.
  The other global properties have their default values.
  FILEA's properties would be the global ones except for the time delay.
  FILEB's properties would be the global ones except for the time delay,
  the time delay increment, and the signal polarity.
  FILEC's properties would be the same as the global ones.
  FILED's properties would be the global ones except for the weighting factor.
  Now you enter::
    
      u:  SUMSTACK

  The summation is done on the four files in the stack file list::

     FILEA, FILEB, FILEC, and FILED.

  The time delays are  2.0, 3.0, 1.0, and 1.0 respectively.
  The polarity of FILEC is reversed.
  FILED's weighting in the summation is half that of the other files.
  Now you enter::
    
      u:  INCREMENTSTACK
      u:  CHANGESTACK FILEC NORMAL
      u:  SUMSTACK

  This stack is performed with the following delays::

       2.03, 3.01, 1.03, and 1.03.  The polarity of FILEC is now normal.

  Now you enter::
    
      u:  DELETESTACK FILED
      u:  INCREMENTSTACK
      u:  SUMSTACK

  This third stack is performed on the three files::

     FILEA, FILEB, and FILEC.  The delays are 2.06, 3.02, and 1.06 respectively.
    
ERRORS MESSAGES
---------------
- 5108: Maximum length of stack file list exceeded.
- 1306: Illegal operation on unevenly spaced file

  - stacking module requires evenly spaced data files.

- 1307: Illegal operation on spectral file
- 5109: Sampling intervals are not equal.

  - the sampling rates for all files in the stack file list must agree
     to within a given tolerance.

- the SRCHECK command can turn this check off or change the tolerance.
- the default check is for agreement within machine roundoff error.


LIMITATIONS
-----------
  The maximum number of files in the stack file list is limited
  to the maximum number of data files allowed by SAC.
