VELOCITYMODEL
+++++++++++++

SUMMARY
-------
Sets stack velocity model parameters for computing dynamic delays.

SYNTAX
------
    ``[V]ELOCITY[M]ODEL n options``

    where options are one or more of the following:

    ``ON|OFF``
    ``REFRACTEDWAVE|NORMALMOVEOUT``
    ``FLIP``
    ``VAPP v|CALCULATE``
    ``T0VM v|CALCULATE``
    ``DVM v1 [v2]``
    ``TVM v1 [v2]``
    ``VAPPI v``
    ``T0VMI v``

INPUT
-----
   :n:   Set velocity model number.  This is either "1" or "2".
      The use of each velocity model is described below.

   :ON|OFF:   Turn velocity model option on or off.  When this
       option is on the model is applied. When off it is ignored.

   :REFRACTEDWAVE:   Turn velocity model option on and change to 
       the "refracted wave" model.

   :NORMALMOVEOUT:   Turn velocity model option on and change to 
       the "normal moveout" model.

   :FLIP:   Interchange the properties of the two velocity models.

   :VAPP v:   Set the apparent velocity to v.

   :VAPP CALCULATE:  Have SAC calculate the apparent velocity.

   :T0VM v:  Set the time axis intercept to v.

   :T0VM CALCULATE:  Have SAC calculate the time axis intercept.

   :DVM v1 [v2]:  Define one or two reference distances.

   :TVM v1 [v2]:  Define one or two reference times.

   :VAPPI v:  Set the apparent velocity increment to v.  The apparent
       velocity is incremented by this ammount each time the
       INCREMENTSTACK command is executed.

   :T0VMI v:  Set the time axis intercept increment to v.  The time
       axis intercept is incremented by this ammount each time the
       INCREMENTSTACK command is executed.

DEFAULT VALUES
--------------
     
   `` VELOCITYMODEL 1 OFF``
   `` VELOCITYMODEL 2 OFF``

DESCRIPTION
-----------
  The first velocity model is used in calculating dynamic station delays
  for a particular phase.

  It is applied when doing a stack summation ( SUMSTACK),
  a stack plot ( PLOTSTACK), or a record section plot ( PLOTRECORDSECTION.)
  The second velocity model is used in the record section plot to
  show delays associated with a second phase.
  The parameters associated with the two velocity models can be easily flipped.

  There are two different types of velocity models ("refracted wave" and
  "normal moveout") that can be applied.
  They are defined by the following equations::

      TDELAY = TVM(1) - ( T0VM + DIST / VAPP )
      TDELAY = TVM(1) - SQRT ( T0VM**2 + ( DIST / VAPP )**2 )

   There are several ways in which these velocity model delays can be 
   calculated:

   Enter values for VAPP, T0VM, and TVM(1) directly.

   Enter values for DVM(1), TVM(1), and either VAPP or T0VM.
   SAC will calculate the missing variable such that TDELAY will be zero
   at the distance given by DVM(1).

   Enter values for DVM(1), TVM(1), DVM(2), and TVM(2).
   SAC will calculate both VAPP and T0VM such that TDELAY will be zero
   at the distance given by DVM(1).

EXAMPLES
--------
  To set the first stack velocity model the refracted wave model with an
  apparent velocity of 6.5 km/sec and to have SAC calculate T0VM such that the
  delay at 200 km will be zero::

    u: VELOCITYMODEL 1 REFRACTEDWAVE VAPP 6.5 T0VM CALCULATE DVM 200 TVM 35
