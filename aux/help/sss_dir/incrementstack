INCREMENTSTACK
++++++++++++++

SUMMARY
-------
Increments properties for files in the stack file list.

SYNTAX
------

   ``[I]NCREMENT[S]TACK``

DEFAULTS VALUES
---------------
    All property INCREMENT values are initially 0.

DESCRIPTION
-----------
  The properties that can be incremented are the static time delay,
  the apparent velocity, and the velocity model intercept time.
  Property increment values of 0. obviously leave those properties unchanged.
  The apparent velocity or the velocity model intercept time can be incremented,
  and the other one calculated in order to maintain a zero delay at a
  specified point.

EXAMPLES
--------
  An example of the use of this command to INCREMENT static time delays is
  shown in the ADDSTACK command.  An example of the use of this command
  to increment dynamic delays is given below:::

     u: ADDSTACK FILEA
     u: ADDSTACK FILEB
     u: ADDSTACK FILEC
     u: ADDSTACK FILED
     u: VELOCITYMODEL 1 REFR VAPP 7.9 VAPPI 0.1 T0VM CALC DIST 320. TVM 45.
     u: SUMSTACK
     u: WRITESTACK STACK1
     u: INCREMENTSTACK
     u: SUMSTACK
     u: WRITESTACK STACK2
     u: INCREMENTSTACK
     u: SUMSTACK
     u: WRITESTACK STACK3

  The above commands will produce three summations, the results being
  stored in SAC files STACK1, STACK2, and STACK3.
  The refracted wave velocity model is used and the apparent velocities, VAPP
  are 7.9, 8.0 and 8.1 respectively.
  The velocity model intercept time, T0VM, is calculated in each case
  to maintain a zero delay at the point 320. km and 45. seconds.
