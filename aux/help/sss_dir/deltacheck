DESCRIPTION
-----------
  This command changes the sampling rate checking option.
  When this option is off, no check is made to see if the sampling rates
  for each of the files in the stack file list agree.
  When this option is on, then the sampling rates must agree within a given
  tolerance or it is considered an error.
  The tolerance can be set to a factor near the roundoff error for a particular
  machine or it can be set to a specific value.
  The absolute value of the difference between all sampling rates must be
  less than or equal to this tolerance in order to be allowed.
  
ERROR MESSAGES
--------------
   The check is done and the error is reported as files are added to the
   stack file list (see  ADDSTACK).
