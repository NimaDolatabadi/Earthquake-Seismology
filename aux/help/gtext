SUMMARY
-------
Controls the quality and font of text used in plots.

SYNTAX
------

  ``GTEXT {SOFTWARE|HARDWARE},{FONT n},{SIZE size} {SYSTEM system} {NAME name}``

INPUT
-----
   :SOFTWARE:  Use software text in plots.
    
   :HARDWARE:  Use hardware text in plots.
    
   :FONT n:  Set software text font to n.  The range for n is currently 1
       to 8.
    
   :FORCE n:  Use harware text in all cases for plots. Overrides HARDWARE
       option.  HARDWARE still uses software for rotated fonts.
    
   :SIZE size:  Change default text size.  See TSIZE_ command for
       definitions of text sizes.  Option size  is one fo the following:

    ``TINY|SMALL|MEDIUM|LARGE``
   
   :SYSTEM system:  Change the Font subsystem, current values are
       - SOFTWARE  Traditional SAC Font system
       - CORE      X11 Core Fonts, this creates a real font
       - XFT       X Freetype library, this creates a real font

   :NAME name:  Change the default font used in the CORE or XFT subsystem
       Available fonts are: Helvetica, Times-Roman, Courier, ZapfDingbats

    
DEFAULT VALUES
--------------

  ``GTEXT SOFTWARE FONT 1 SIZE SMALL``

DESCRIPTION
-----------
  Software text uses the text display capabilities of the graphics
  library.  Characters are stored as small line segments and thus can be scaled
  to any desired size and can be rotated to any desired angle.  Use of software
  text will produce the same result on different graphics devices.  Use of
  software text is slower than hardware text, especially to the terminal.  There
  are currently 8 software fonts available: simplex block (font 1), simplex
  italics (2), duplex block (3), duplex italics (4), complex block (5), complex
  italics (6), triplex block (7), and triplex italics (8).  Examples of each
  font and each default text size is shown in the figure on the next page.
  Hardware text uses the text display capabilities of the graphics device
  itself.  Hardware text sizes vary considerably between devices, so its use
  can produce different looking plots on different devices.  If a device has
  more than one hardware text size, the one closest to the desired size is used.
  Its primary asset is that it is much faster than software text and should
  therefore be used only when speed is more important than quality.

EXAMPLES
--------
  To select the triplex software font::

      u:  GTEXT SOFTWARE FONT 6
