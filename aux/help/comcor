DESCRIPTION
-----------
   SAC checks the form and content of each command you type.  When it detects an
   error, it sends an error message to you, telling you what the error was and
   where it occurred.  If the command correction option is on, SAC then lets you
   correct the command and have SAC automatically reexecute it.  If this option
   is off, SAC merely prints the error message and returns control to you.  More
   details and several examples are given in the User's Guide.  "Command
   Correction Capability" in the SAC Users Manual.
