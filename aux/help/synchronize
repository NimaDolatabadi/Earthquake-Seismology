SYNCHRONIZE
+++++++++++

SUMMARY
-------
Synchronizes the reference times of all files in memory.

SYNTAX
------

  ``SYNCHRONIZE {ROUND {ON|OFF}} {BEGIN {ON|OFF}}``

INPUT
-----
   :ROUND {ON}:  Turn begin time rounding on.  When this opotions is on,
       the begin times for each file are rounded to the nearest multiple
       of the sampling interval.
    
   :ROUND OFF:  Turn begin time rounding off.
    
   :BEGIN {ON}:  Sets begin time of each file to zero.
    
   :BEGIN OFF:  Maintains the GMT values of the reference times.
    
DEFAULT VALUES
--------------

  ``SYNCHRONIZE ROUND OFF BEGIN OFF``

DESCRIPTION
-----------
   This command synchronizes the references times for all files in memory.
   It determines the latest starting time of all files by examining their
   reference times and beginning offset times.  This latest starting time then
   becomes the reference time for ALL of the files in memory.  New values for all
   of the offset times (B, E, A, Tn, etc.) for each of the files are then
   calculated.
   This command is useful when a set of files have different reference
   times and you want to use the CUT_ or XLIM_ command to analyze or plot portions
   of them.  Once they have been synchronized to the same reference time, the
   cuts will then refer to the exact same GMT time window.
   If the BEGIN option is used, GMT values of reference times are not
   preserved.  The BEGIN option sets the kztime of all files the same, it sets the
   kzdate of all files the same, and it sets the begin time of all files to zero.
   Other reference points retain their relation to the begin time of the file.

EXAMPLES
--------
   Assume you read two files into memory with different reference times::

      u:  READ FILE1 FILE2
      u:  LISTHDR B KZTIME KZDATE
      s:
      s:  FILE: FILE1
      s:  -----------
      s:         B = 0.
      s:    KZTIME = 10:38:14.000
      s:    KZDATE = MAR 29 (088), 1981
      s:
      s:  FILE: FILE2
      s:  -----------
      s:         B = 10.00
      s:    KZTIME = 10:40:10.000
      s:    KZDATE = MAR 29 (088), 1981

   

   The files have the same reference date but different reference times and
   different beginning offsets.  Now if you execute the SYNCHRONIZE_ command
   followed by another LISTHDR_ you would find::

      u:  SYNCHRONIZE
      u:  LISTHDR
      s:
      s:  FILE: FILE1
      s:  -----------
      s:         B = -126.00
      s:    KZTIME = 10:40:20.000
      s:    KZDATE = MAR 29 (088), 1981
      s:
      s:  FILE: FILE2
      s:  -----------
      s:         B = 0.
      s:    KZTIME = 10:40:20.000
      s:    KZDATE = MAR 29 (088), 1981

   

   Now the files in memory have the same reference time which is the beginning
   of the later file.  If there had been any defined time markers in these
   headers, their values would be adjusted so that they point to the same time
   as before.
