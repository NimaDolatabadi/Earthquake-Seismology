READHDR
+++++++

SUMMARY
-------
Reads headers from SAC data files into memory.

SYNTAX
------

  ``READHDR [options] [filelist]``

   where options is one or more of the following:

  ``MORE``

  ``TRUST ON|OFF``

  ``COMMIT|ROLLBACK|RECALLTRACE``

  ``DIR CURRENT|name``

  ALL options MUST preceed any element in the filelist.

INPUT
-----
   :MORE:  Place the new data file headers in memory AFTER the old ones.
       If this option is omitted, the new data file headers REPLACE the
       old ones.
    
   :Note:  if the MORE option is not specified, the COMMIT, ROLLBACK,
       and RECALLTRACE options have no effect.
    
   :TRUST ON|OFF: This option is used to resolve an ambiguity in converting
       files from SAC to CSS format.  When converting the data,
       matching event IDs could mean the files have identical
       event information, or they could be an artifact of the
       merging of these two very different formats.  When TRUST
       is ON, SAC is more likely to accept matching event IDs as
       identical event information than when TRUST is OFF,
       depending on the history of READ_ commands associated with
       the current data files in memory.
    
   :COMMIT:  If the MORE option is specified, the COMMIT option commits
       headers and waveforms in SAC memory -- removing any previous
       versions of headers or waveforms from RAM -- prior to
       reading more files.  COMMIT is the default.
    
   :ROLLBACK:  If the MORE option is specified, the ROLLBACK option reverts
       to the last committed version of the header and waveform
       before reading more files.
    
   :RECALLTRACE:  If the MORE option is specified, the RECALLTRACE option:

       - reverts to the last committed version of the waveform,
       - reverts to the last committed version of those header
       	 variables closely linked to the waveform,
       - commits those header variables which are loosely linked
       	 to the waveform. (use HELP_ RECALLTRACE for a list of which 
	 header variables are committed, and which are rolled back.)
    
   :DIR CURRENT:  Read all simple filenames (with or without wildcards)
       from the current directory.  This is the directory from which you
       started SAC.
    
   :DIR name:  Read all simple filenames (with or without wildcards) from
       the directory called name.  This may be a relative or absolute
       directory name.
    
   :filelist:  file | wild .
    
   :file:  A legal filename.  This may be a simple filename or a pathname.
       The pathname can be a relative or absolute one.  See the
       DESCRIPTION and EXAMPLES sections of the READ_ command for more details.
    
   :wild:  A wildcard laden token that expands to a list of filenames.
       See the DESCRIPTION and EXAMPLES sections of the READ_ command and
       the WILD_ command for more details.
    
DESCRIPTION
-----------
   This command reads the headers from a set of SAC files into memory.  You can
   then list the header contents (LISTHDR), change header values (CHNHDR), and
   then write the headers back to disk (WRITEHDR).  This is much faster than
   reading entire files into memory, when only the headers are needed.

   All commands which load data into memory have are now monitored to maintain
   a level of confidence in the event information when moved from the SAC data
   buffer to the CSS data buffer.  For READHDR_, when the confidence is HIGH 
   that  all the data files are cosistent in the numbering of event IDs, 
   matching  event IDs are treated as having identical event information.  
   When the confidence is LOW in READHDR_, matching event IDs are understood 
   as an artifact, and new event IDs are generated for the incoming file. 
   For more details use HELP_ READ_.


ERROR MESSAGES
--------------
- 1301: No data files read in.

  - haven't given a list of files to read.  
  - none of the files in the list could be read.

- 1314: Data file list can't begin with a number.
- 1315: Maximum number of files in data file list is
- 1335: Illegal operation---only data file headers in memory.

  - only LISTHDR_, CHNHDR_, and WRITEHDR_ operations.  can be performed after a
    READHDR_.

WARNING MESSAGES
----------------
- 0101: opening file
- 0108: File does not exist:
- 0114: reading file

  - Normally when SAC encounters one of these errors it skips that file and
    reads the remainder.  These errors can be made to be fatal using 
    the READERR_ command.
