YFUDGE
++++++

SUMMARY
-------
Changes the y axis "fudge factor."

SYNTAX
------

  ``YFUDGE ON|OFF|v``

INPUT
-----
   :ON:  Turn fudge option on but don't change fudge factor.
    
   :OFF:  Turn fudge option off.
    
   :v:  Turn fudge option on and change fudge factor to v.
    
DEFAULT VALUES
--------------

  ``YFUDGE 0.03``

DESCRIPTION
-----------
  When this option is on, the actual axis limits are changed by a "fudge
  factor".  The algorithm for a linearly scaled axis is::

    YDIFF=YFUDGE*(YMAX-YMIN)
    YMIN=YMIN-YDIFF
    YMAX=YMAX+YDIFF

  where YMIN and YMAX are the data extrema and YFUDGE_ is the fudge factor.  The
  algorithm is similiar for logarithmically scaled axes.  The fudge option only
  applies when the axis limits are scaled to the data extrema (see YLIM.)
