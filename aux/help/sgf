SGF
+++

SUMMARY
-------
Controls the SAC Graphics File (SGF) device options.

SYNTAX
------

  ``SGF {options}``

   where options are one or more of the following:

  ``PREFIX text``

  ``NUMBER n``

  ``DIRECTORY CURRENT|pathname``

  ``SIZE NORMAL|FIXED v|SCALED v``

  ``OVERWRITE ON|OFF``

INPUT
-----
   :PREFIX text:  Set the frame prefix to text (up to 24 characters long.)
    
   :NUMBER n:  Set next frame number to n.  If n is zero, then SAC
       searches the directory for SGFs and sets the frame number to the
       next value in the sequence.
    
   :DIRECTORY CURRENT:  Put the SGFs in the current directory.
    
   :DIRECTORY pathname:  Put the SGFs in the directory specified by
       pathname.
    
   :SIZE NORMAL:  Produce a "normal" sized plot.  A normal plot has a
       viewspace (the maximum plotting area) of 10 by 7.5 inches.  Using
       default values, the viewport (the portion of the viewspace where
       the plot is drawn excluding axes and labels) itself is approximately 8 by 5 inches.
    
   :SIZE FIXED v:  Produce a plot where the x viewport is v inches in
       length.
    
   :SIZE SCALED v:  Produce a plot where the x viewport in inches is
       determined by multiplying v by the x world coordinate limits.
    
   :OVERWRITE ON|OFF:  When it is turned on, the file numbers are not
       incremented.  Each new file erases the previous file.
       This is especially useful with the PRINT_ option on
       most plot commands.
    
DEFAULT VALUES
--------------

  ``SGF PREFIX F NUMBER 1 DIRECTORY CURRENT SIZE NORMAL``

  ``ALTERNATE NAMES: ID for PREFIX and FRAME for NUMBER.``

DESCRIPTION
-----------
  This command controls the frame naming conventions and final plot size
  for subsequent SAC Graphics Files.  Each frame is stored in a separate file on
  disk.  Each frame name is made up of four parts. In order they are:

  pathname The optional directory path name.

  prefix The frame prefix.

  number The three digit frame number.

  .sgf The suffix used to denote a SAC Graphics File.

  By default the frame prefix is simply the letter "f", the frame number
  1 and the files are put in the current directory (i.e. the first name is
  "f001.sgf".) You might want to changed the prefix to identify a set of files
  you wish to save.  You can also specify a directory in which to store the
  files.  This is very useful when you are changing directories while running
  SAC and want all the frame files in one place.  The frame number is
  incremented each time a new frame is created.  You can force the frame number
  to start at any given value.  Starting at a number other than 1 might be
  useful if you are generating figures for a report over several days and wish
  to keep them in sequential order.

  The folowing paragraph was writen more thaan 20 years ago, and so far as we can
  see the size options in the current SGFTOPS program provides a much cleaner
  way to change the overall size of the plot in an SGF file.  Based on sample
  runs using the examples given below, the output SGF files all have the same
  physical size, and the aspect ratio of the plots are all the same.  Hence, 
  SGF SIZE simply introduces a scaling factor for the plots.  We are leaving in
  the paragraph and examples because they seem to work, and there may be a
  feature we are missing.
  
  There are several options that can be used to control the size of the
  plot.  A normal plot has viewspace limits of 10 by 7.5 inches.  Using the
  default viewport limits, this results in an approximately 8 by 5 inch plot.
  You can force the x viewport to a fixed length or you can have the x viewport
  be scaled to the world coordinate limits of your data.  This size information
  is written to the SGF_.  It is the responsibility of program that converts a
  SGF_ to a specific output device to generate the coding to produce a correctly
  sized plot.  SGFTOPS performs this conversion correctly although plots larger
  than a single page have to post-processed correctly. 
  
EXAMPLES
--------
  To define a directory other than where you are attached and to reset to frame
  number to the next value in a sequence::

      u:   SGF DIRECTORY /MYDIR/SGFSTORE FRAME 0

  To set the x viewport plot size to 3 inches (i.e., wallet size)::

      u:   SGF SIZE FIXED 3.0

  For create a poster size plot to put on your wall::

      u:   SGF SIZE FIXED 30.0

  To set the x viewport plot size to be 1 inch long for every 10 seconds of
  seismic data::

      u:   SGF SIZE SCALED 0.1

  In this last example, a plot where the data was 60 seconds in duration would
  be 6 inches long whereas a plot where the data was 600 seconds in duration
  would be 60 inches long and would require special post processing to produce.
