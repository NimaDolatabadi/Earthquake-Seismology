SMOOTH
++++++

SUMMARY
-------
Applies an arithmetic smoothing algorithm to the data.

SYNTAX
------

  ``SMOOTH {MEAN|MEDIAN},{HALFWIDTH n}``

INPUT
-----
   :MEAN:  Apply a mean (average) smoothing algorithm.
    
   :MEDIAN:  Apply a median point smoothing algorithm.
    
   :HALFWIDTH n:  Set halfwidth of smoothing window to n.  The moving
       window will contain n points on each side of the point being
       smoothed.
    
DEFAULT VALUES
--------------

  ``SMOOTH MEAN HALFWIDTH 1``

DESCRIPTION
-----------
   This command applies an arithmetic smoothing algorithm to each data point.
   The type of algorithm and the size of the sliding window around each data
   point can be varied.  The size of the window is defined by specifying its
   halfwidth.  This forces the moving window to be centered around each data point
   and forces the window size to be an odd number of points, which makes the
   algorithms easier and less ambiguous.
