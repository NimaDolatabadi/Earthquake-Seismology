PLOT2
+++++

SUMMARY
-------
Generates a multi-trace single-window (overlay) plot.

SYNTAX
------

  ``[P]LOT[2] {ABSOLUTE|RELATIVE} {PRINT {pname} }``

INPUT
-----
   :ABSOLUTE:  Plot files treating time as an absolute.  Files with
       different begin times will be shifted relative to the first file.
    
   :RELATIVE:  Plot each file relative to it's own begin time.
    
   :PRINT {pname}:  Prints the resulting plot to the printer named in
       pname, or to the default printer if pname is not used.  (This
       requires that program sgftops is in the path.)
    
    
DEFAULT VALUES
--------------

  ``P2 ABSOLUTE``

DESCRIPTION
-----------
  All files in the data file list are plotted in the same plot window.  An
  optional legend containing the plot symbol and file name can be generated.
  Fixed x and y axis limits may be defined before using this command.  See the
  XLIM_ and YLIM_ commands.  The plot is sized to the extrema of the entire file
  list if fixed limits are not requested. The location of the legend is controlled 
  by the FILEID_ command.

  Unlike PLOT_ and PLOT1_, PLOT2 will plot spectral data.  Real/Imaginary 
  data is plotted as Real vs. Frequency.  Amplitude/Phase data is plotted 
  as Amplitude vs. Frequency.  Imaginary and Phase information are ignored.  
  Spectral data is always plotted in relative mode.  Note that in the fequency
  domain,b, e, and delta are reset to 0, the Nqquist frequency, and df resjpectively.
  The header values depmin and dapmax are not changed.  As with PLOTSP_, if XLIM_ is
  off, the plot starts at DF=DELTA rather than 0.  If XLIM_ or YLIM_ were changed
  before transferring to the frequency domain, it is best to enter XLIM off and 
  YLIM off before calling PLOT2.

  Note:  If for some reason, the user has both time-series data and spectral 
  data in memory at the same time and does not elect to use the RELATIVE 
  option, the time-series files will be plotted ABSOLUTE and the spectral 
  files will be plotted RELATIVE.  Relative mode means relative to the 
  first file.  So the order of the files in memory will effect the relation 
  of the plots with respect to each other.
