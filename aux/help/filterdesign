FILTERDESIGN
++++++++++++

SUMMARY
-------
Produces a graphic display of a filter's digital vs. analog characteristics
for: amplitude, phase, and impulse response curves, and the group delay.

SYNTAX
------

  ``FILTERDESIGN [PRINT [pname] ] [FILE [prefix] ][filteroptions] [delta]``

   where filteroptions are the same as those used in the various
   filter commands in SAC, including the filter type.
   delta is the sampling interval of the data

   **Note** Order of options is important.  If the PRINT option is
   used, it must be the first option.  If the FILE option is used, it
   must precede the filter options.``

INPUT
-----

  :PRINT {pname}  :  Prints the resulting plot to the printer named in
     pname, or to the default printer if pname is not used.``
     **Note** this must be the first option given on the command line.
     (This makes use of the SGF capability.)

  :FILE {prefix}  :  Writes three SAC files to disk.  Theses files
     contain the digital responses determined in
     the FILTERDESIGN:

  :[prefix].spec: is of type IAMPH, and contains both the amplitude
     and phase information from the FILTERDESIGN.

  :[prefix].gd: is of type ITIME, and contains the group delay
     information from the FILTERDESIGN.
     **Note** that in spite of the fact that the file is of
     type ITIME, group delay is a function of frequency.
     It is incumbent upon the user to remember that
     even though the plots will have seconds for
     units, the actual units are hertz.

  :[prefix].imp: is of type ITIME, and contains the impulse
     response.

  In each of these SAC files, the user header fields are set
  as follows:

  :user0:  pass code

    :1: low pass
    :2: high pass
    :3: band pass
    :4: band reject

  :user1:  type code

    :1: Butterworth
    :2: Bessel
    :3: C1
    :4: C2

  :user2:  number of poles
  :user3:  number of passes
  :user4:  tranbw
  :user5:  attenuation
  :user6:  delta
  :user7:  first corner
  :user8:  second corner if present, or -12345 if not

  :kuser0: pass (lowpass, highpass, bandpass, or bandrej)
  :kuser1: type (Butter, Bessel, C1, or C2 )


DEFAULT VALUES
--------------

  Only the delta parameter has a default (0.025 seconds). Options for filter
  type and related parameters must be supplied.

DESCRIPTION
-----------
  The FILTERDESIGN_ command is implemented through XAPiir, a basic
  recursive digital filtering package (see REFERENCES). XAPiir implements the
  standard recursive digital filter design through bilinear transformation of
  prototype analog filters.  These prototype filters, specified in terms of
  poles and zeros, are then transformed to highpass, bandpass and band reject
  filters using analog spectral transformations.  FILTERDESIGN_ displays digital
  filter responses as solid lines and analog responses as dashed lines.  On
  color monitors, digital curves are blue while analog curves are amber.

EXAMPLES
--------
  The following example shows how the FILTERDESIGN_ command is used to
  produce the digital and analog response curves for a highpass, 2 Hz., six
  pole, two pass filter on data with a sampling rate of .025 seconds.::

    u1: fd hp c 2 n 6 p 2 delta .025
