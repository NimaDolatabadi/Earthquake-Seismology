WIDTH
+++++

SUMMARY
-------
Controls line-width selection for graphics devices.

SYNTAX
------

  ``WIDTH  {ON|OFF|linewidth} options``

   where options are one or more of the following:

  ``{SKELETON width}``

  ``{INCREMENT {ON|OFF}}``

  ``{LIST STANDARD|widthlist}``


  and where linewidth, width and widthlist are integer values.

  **SPECIAL NOTE** The LIST option must appear last in this command.

INPUT
-----
   :WIDTH ON:  Turn WIDTH_ option on but don't change current width values.
   
   :WIDTH OFF:  Turn width option off.
    
   :WIDTH linewidth:  Change data width to linewidth and turn WIDTH_
       option on.
    
   :SKELETON width:  Change width of skeleton to width and turn WIDTH_
       option on.
    
   :INCREMENT {ON}:  Increment width from widthlist list after each data
       file is plotted.
    
   :INCREMENT OFF:  Do not increment data line width.
    
   :LIST widthlist:  Change the content of the width list.  Enter list of
       widths.  Sets data width to first width in list and turns width
       option on.
    
   :LIST STANDARD:  Change to the standard width list.  Sets data width to
       first width in list and turns width option on.
    
DEFAULT VALUES
--------------

  ``WIDTH OFF SKELETON 1 INCREMENT OFF LIST STANDARD``

DESCRIPTION
-----------
  This command controls width attributes for those devices which can
  display a large number of line-widths.  The data width is the width that is
  used when plotting the data files.  The data width may be automatically
  incremented from a width list after each data file is plotted.
  The skeleton width is the width used to plot the axes.  Only plot axes
  change with SKELETON option.  Grids, text, labels and frame ids are always
  displayed with the thin line-width of value 1.

  If plotting several data files on the same plot, you may want each to
  be in a different width.  This is done using the INCREMENT option.  When this
  option is on, the data width is incremented from a list of widths each time a
  data file is plotted.  The order and value of widths in the standard 
  (default) list is::

     1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10

  You may change the order or content of this list using the LIST option.  This
  is useful for doing overlay plots (see PLOT2) when you want the same widths
  used in the same order on each plot.

EXAMPLES
--------
  To select an incrementing data width starting with 1::

    u:  WIDTH 1 INCREMENT

  To set up an incrementing data width list of 1, 3, and 5 with an skeleton 
  of 2::

    u:  WIDTH SKELETON 2 INCREMENT list 1 3 5
