MULF
++++

SUMMARY
-------
Multiplies a set of files by the data in memory.

SYNTAX
------

  ``MULF {NEWHDR ON|OFF} filelist``

INPUT
-----
   :NEWHDR ON|OFF:  By default, the resultant file will take its
       header field from the original file in memory.
       Turning NEWHDR ON, causes the header fields to be taken from
       the new file in the filelist.
    
   :filelist:  A list of SAC binary data files.  This list may contain
       simple filenames, full or relative pathnames, and wildcard
       characters.  See the READ_ command for a complete description.
    
DESCRIPTION
-----------
  This command can be used to multiply a single file by a set of files or to
  multiply one set of files by another set.  An example of each case is
  presented below.  The files must be evenly spaced and should have the same
  sampling interval and number of points.  This last two restrictions can be
  eliminated using the BINOPERR_ command.  If there are more data files in 
  memory than in the filelist, then the last file in the filelist is used 
  for the remainder of the data files in memory.

EXAMPLES
--------
  To multiply three files by a single file::

      u:  READ FILE1 FILE2 FILE3
      u:  MULF FILE4

  To multiply two files by two other files::

      u:  READ FILE1 FILE2
      u:  MULF FILE3 FILE4

HEADER CHANGES
--------------
   If NEWHDR is OFF (the default) the headers in memory are unchanged).
   If NEWHDR is ON, the headers are replaced with the headers from the
   files in the filelist.

ERROR MESSAGES
--------------
- 1301: No data files read in.
- 1803: No binary data files read in.
- 1307: Illegal operation on spectral file
- 1306: Illegal operation on unevenly spaced file
- 1801: Header field mismatch:

  - either the sampling interval or the number of points are not equal.  - can
    be controlled using the BINOPERR_ command.

WARNING MESSAGES
----------------
- 1802: Time overlap:

  - the file multiplication is still performed.
