+++++

SUMMARY
-------
Sets (defines) values of blackboard variables.

SYNTAX
------

  ``SETBB variable {APPEND} value {variable {APPEND} value ...}``

INPUT
-----
   :variable:  The name of a blackboard variable.  It may be a new
       variable or one that already has a value. The variable name can be
       up to 32 characters in length.
    
   :value:  The new value of that blackboard variable.  It must be
       enclosed in single or double quotes if it contains any spaces.
    
   :APPEND:  Append value to the old value of variable.  If this option is
       omitted then the new value replaces the old value.
    
DESCRIPTION
-----------
   The blackboard is a place to temporarily store information.  This
   information can later be accessed by the GETBB_ command or used directly in a
   command by preceeding the name of the variable with a percent sign ("%".) If
   you want to concantenate some other text string on the end of a blackboard
   variable you need to put a second percent sign at the end of the name.  You
   can also use the EVALUATE_ command to perform basic arithmetic operations on
   blackboard variables and store the results in new blackboard variables.  You
   can unset (delete) blackboard variables using the UNSETBB_ command.

EXAMPLES
--------
  To set several blackboard variables at once::

      u:  SETBB C1 2.45 C2 4.94

  To later use these variables in a command::

      u:  BANDPASS CORNERS %C1 %C2

  To set a blackboard variable that contains spaces::

      u:  SETBB MYTITLE 'Sample filter response'

  To check and make sure the value is correct::

      u:  GETBB MYTITLE
      s:  MYTITLE = Sample filter response

  To later use this variable in the title command it must be enclosed in quotes
  and have a percent sign on both ends of the name::

      u:  TITLE '%MYTITLE%'

  See the section on Macros in the SAC Users Manual for more examples of the
  use of blackboard variables in macros.
