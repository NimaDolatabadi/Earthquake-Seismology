SYNTAX

  ``SETMACRO {MORE} directory {directory ...}``

INPUT

   :directory:  The name of a directory in which SAC macro files are stored.
                This may be either a relative or absolute directory name.
                On some operating systems, the directory path may be case

DESCRIPTION
-----------
   This command lets you define a set of directories to search when executing
   SAC macro files using the MACRO_ command.  You can define up to 100 such
   directories.

   MORE:	When the MORE option is used with setmacro, the specified
   directories are added to the existing list.  When MORE is not used
   with setmacros, the existing list is replaced with the new list.

   When the MACRO_ command is run, SAC searches for the macro in the current
   directory; if no file is found with the given name, SAC searches the
   directories listed in SETMACRO in the order that they are listed.  If
   there are still no files found with the given name, SAC searches the global
   macro directory.

   See the section on Macros in the SAC Users Manual.
