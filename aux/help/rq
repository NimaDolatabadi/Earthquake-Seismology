RQ
++

SUMMARY
-------
Removes the seismic Q factor from spectral data.

SYNTAX
------

  ``RQ [Q v],[R v],[C v]``

INPUT
-----
   :Q v:  Set quality factor to v.
    
   :R v:  Set distance in km. to v.
    
   :C v:  Set group velocity in km/sec to v
    
DEFAULT VALUES
--------------

  ``RQ Q 1. R 0. C 1.``

DESCRIPTION
-----------
  The equation used to correct the amplitude is given below::

    AMP_corrected(F) = AMP_uncorrected(F) * Exp( (pi*R*F) / (Q*C) )

  where:
  F is the frequency in Hz.  R is the distance in km.  C is the group velocity
  in km/sec.  Q is the the nondimensional quality factor.

ERROR MESSAGES
--------------
- 1301: No data files read in.
- 1305: Illegal operation on time series file

WARNING MESSAGES
----------------
- 1604: Following file now in amplitude-phase format:

  - file was in real-imaginary format.

LIMITATIONS
-----------
  Can only handle constants for the various parameters.  Modifications to allow
  these parameters to vary with frequency may be added at a later date.
