KEEPAM
++++++

SUMMARY
-------
Keep amplitude component of spectral files (of either the AMPH or RLIM
format) in SAC memory.

SYNTAX
------

  ``KEEPAM``

DESCRIPTION
-----------
   This command is an easy way for users to drop the phase component, so that
   the amplitude data may be subjected to algebraic operations which require
   single-dimensional data.  If the files exist in the RLIM format, the data is
   first converted to the AMPH format, before phase is dropped.  The resulting
   data files containing the amplitude component will exist as as generic xy
   files, so that they can be distinguished for time-domain files.  May 28, 1991
