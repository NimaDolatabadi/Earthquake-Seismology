DIVOMEGA
++++++++

SUMMARY
-------
Performs integration in the frequency domain.

DESCRIPTION
-----------
  This command divides each point of a spectral file by its frequency
  given by::

     OMEGA = 2.0 * PI * FREQ

  This is analogous to integrating the equivalent time series file.  The
  spectral file can in either amplitude-phase or real-imaginary format.
  This is often convenient with normal data but is critical when obtaining
  the FFT_ of data whose spectra ranges over many orders of magnitude.  For
  example, suppose you have prewhitened a data file by using the DIF_ command,
  and then taken its transform using the FFT_ command.  The effect of the
  differentiation in time domain can be removed by an integration in the
  frequency domain using this command.

EXAMPLES
--------
  The steps discussed above are shown in this example::

      u:  READ FILE1
      u:  DIF
      u:  FFT AMPH
      u:  DIVOMEGA
