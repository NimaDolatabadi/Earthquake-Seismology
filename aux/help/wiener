WIENER
++++++

SUMMARY
-------
Designs and applies an adaptive Wiener filter.

SYNTAX
------

  ``WIENER {[W]INDOW pdw} {[N]COEFF n} {MU OFF | ON | v} {[EPS]ILON OFF | ON | e}``

INPUT
-----
   :WINDOW pdw:  Set filter design window to pdw.  A partial data window
       which consists of a start time and stop time.  These times can be
       absolute ones or ones relative to certain header fields.  See the
       CUT_ command for details on pdw.
    
   :NCOEFF n:  Set the number of filter coefficients to n.
    
   :MU off | on | v:  Set the adaptation step size parameter.
       Off sets mu to zero.
       On sets mu = 1.95 / Rho(0).  Where Rho(0)
       is the autocorrelation in pdw at zero lag.
       v sets mu = v.
    
   :EPSILON e:  Set ridge regression parameter to epsilon.
       Can help stabilize the wiener filter by
       increasing the diagonal elements of the
       autocorrelation matrix by epsilon.
       When epsilon is ON, SAC will use the value
       entered by the user (or zero if no value was
       entered).
       When epsilon is OFF, SAC will loop through
       the following increasing values of epsilon
       (0.0, 1e-5, 1e-4, 1e-3, 1e-2), until the
       wiener filter is stable, or until the list
       has been exhausted.  If epsilon == 0 does
       not work, SAC will produce one or more warning
       messages.  If none of the values work, SAC will
       produce an error message.
    
    
DEFAULT VALUES
--------------

  ``WIENER WINDOW B 0 10 NCOEFF 30 MU OFF EPSILON OFF``

DESCRIPTION
-----------
  A prediction error filter is designed using the Yule-Walker Method from
  an autocorrelation function estimated from the designated partial data window.
  This window can be any portion of the file.  The filter is then applied to the
  entire signal, i.e. the signal is replaced by the residual error sequence.
  This filter may be used as a prewhitener or as a detection preprocessor
  for transient signals.  The filter can be made adaptive in time by specifying
  a non-zero value for MU.  Large values of MU may cause instability.

EXAMPLES
--------
  The following command would apply a non-adaptive filter, with the first ten
  seconds being the design window::

      u: WIENER WINDOW B 0 10 MU 0.

  The following command would apply a filter with 40 coefficients, with a
  design window from the beginning of the file to 1 second before the first
  arrival::

      u: WIENER NCOEFF 40 WINDOW B A -1

ERROR MESSAGES
--------------
- 1301: No data files read in.
- 1306: Illegal operation on unevenly spaced file
- 1307: Illegal operation on spectral file
- 1608: Bad Wiener filter noise window for file

  - Filter design window does not lie within file window.  - Make sure header
    fields used in window are defined.

WARNING MESSAGES
----------------
- 1609: Numerical instability in Wiener filter for file
- 1614: Numerical instability in Wiener; will retry with epsilon = e
  where e denotes the next value of epsilon to be tried.

  - The filtered data may or may not be incorrect.
