SUMMARY
-------
Controls Math Operator Precedence

SYNTAX
------

  ``MATHOP NORMAL|MATH|FORTRAN|NONE|OLD``

INPUT
-----

   :NORMAL:  Use Normal Math Operator Precedence
   :MATH:    Same as Normal
   :FORTRAN: Same as Normal

   :NONE:    Use No Operator Precedence
   :OLD:     Same as None


DEFAULT VALUES
--------------

  ``MATHOP NORMAL``

DESCRIPTION
-----------
  This command controls math operator prededence.  Normally, multiplication
  and division have a higher predecence than addition and subtraction.
  Exponentiation has the highest precedence.

  Older version of SAC (pre-101.6) used a math evaluation without operator
  precedence.  Terms were evaluated in order where the earlier in the
  expression operators had higher precedence.
  
  If matop is not called, the effect is the same as mathop normal.  The
  function mathop has been introduced to deal with scripts and macros that
  were written using the mathop old precedence.  Rather than change the
  coding, one simply enters mathop old before the lines with inline expressions.

EXAMPLES
--------
  With Operator Precedence::

     SAC> mathop normal
     SAC> evaluate 1+2*3
     ===> 7
     SAC> evaluate 1+(2*3)
     ===> 7

  Without Operator Precedence (as was true without mathop prior to v101.6)::

     SAC> mathop old
     SAC> evaluate 1+2*3
     ===> 9
     SAC> evaluate 1+(2*3)
     ===> 7
