SUMMARY
-------
Computes the best straight line fit to the data in memory and writes
the results to header blackboard variables.

SYNTAX

DESCRIPTION
-----------
   A least squares curve fit to a straight line is calculated.  The slope,
   y intercept, standard deviation of the slope, standard deviation of the
   y intercept, standard deviation of the data and correlation coefficient
   between the data and the linear fit are written to blackboard variables
   SLOPE, YINT, SDSLOPE, SDYINT, SDDATA and CORRCOEF respectively.  The
   data does not have to be evenly spaced.
