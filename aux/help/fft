FFT
+++

SUMMARY
-------
Performs a discrete Fourier transform.

SYNTAX
------

  ``FFT {WOMEAN|WMEAN},{RLIM|AMPH}``

INPUT
-----
   :WOMEAN:  Remove mean before transform.
    
   :WMEAN:  Leave mean in transform.
    
   :RLIM:  Output should be in real-imaginary format.
    
   :AMPH:  Output should be in amplitude-phase format.
    
ALTERNATE FORMS
---------------
Purists may use DFT in place of FFT_.

DEFAULT VALUES
--------------

  ``FFT WMEAN AMPH``

DESCRIPTION
-----------
  Before the transform is performed, each data file is padded with zeros to the
  next power of two.  SAC data files, on disk and in memory, can contain either
  time-series data or spectral data.  The spectral data may be in either
  amplitude-phase format or real-imaginary format.  The IFTYPE field in the
  header tells you which kind of data is stored in a particular file and what
  its format is.  Most commands work on only one type, either time-series or
  spectal.  Certain commands such as FFT_, IFFT_, UNWRAP_, etc. change data in
  memory from one data type or format to another.  The spectral files that 
  result from this command can be plotted using the PLOTSP_ command or saved on 
  disk with the WRITE_ or WRITESP_ command.  If one has more than one data file
  in memory, PLOT2_ can be used to plot the amplitudes or real part.  The SAC
  sign convention is such that the phase for a causal function decreases with
  increasing frequency.  This is the same convention as in program EVALRESP and
  RDSEED.

HEADER CHANGES
--------------
  B, E, and DELTA are changed to the beginning, ending and sampling frequencies
  of the transform respectively.  The original values of B, E, NPTS and DELTA
  are saved as SB, SE, NSNPTS and SDELTA and are restored if an inverse
  transform is done.

ERROR MESSAGES
--------------
- 1301: No data files read in.
- 1306: Illegal operation on unevenly spaced file
- 1307: Illegal operation on spectral file
- 1606: Maximum allowable DFT is

LIMITATIONS
-----------
  The maximum transform is 2**24=16777216 data points.
