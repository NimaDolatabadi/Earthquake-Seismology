  ``XDIV NICE POWER ON``

DESCRIPTION
-----------
   This command controls the selection of x axis division spacings.  Most
   of the time the default "nice-numbered" spacings are satisfactory.  SAC
   determines these based on the minimum and maximum axis limits, the length of
   the axis, and the current axis character size.
   You may also force the division spacing to be a certain value by use of
   the INCREMENT option or you may set the number of division spacings by use of
   the NUMBER option.
