DESCRIPTION
-----------
  This command is a digital approximation used to emulate the response of
  a short-period seismograph which was used by a VELA Program started by the U.
  S. Air Force about 1960.  This Long Range Seismic Measurements (LRSM) program
  used truck vans and trailers to deploy moveable seismic systems, principally
  in North America, to record controlled source seismic experiments.  Most of
  the seismic profiles were radial lines or circular arcs about the Nevada Test
  Site (NTS).  Two semi-permanent sites or installations were Kanab, UT, and
  Mina, NV.

  LLNL continued operation of KN-UT and MI-NV after the LRSM program.
  These two stations used a variable-reluctance short-period seismometer (with
  a natural frequency of 1 Hz, critically damped) which was designed and named
  after Professor Hugo Benioff of Cal Tech.  This short-period seismometer was
  coupled to a galvanometer (with a natural frequency of 5 Hz and damped to 0.9
  critical).  The coupling factor was nominally defined at 0.01 (or loosely
  coupled at low magnification settings which were used for recording the
  larger explosions) and the response was nearly flat-to-velocity between 1 and
  5 Hz.  When LLNL converted this system to a broadband, flat-to-velocity
  telemetered system, an analog filter was designed to shape a passband into
  the LRSM short-period passband.  This command executes a digital equivalent of
  that analog shaping filter which produces an output (measured in nanometers)
  analogous to the LRSM short-period system.
