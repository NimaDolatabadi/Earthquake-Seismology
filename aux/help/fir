FIR
+++

SUMMARY
-------
Applies a finite-impulse-response filter.

SYNTAX
------

  ``FIR {REC|FFT},file``

INPUT
-----
   :FFT:  Apply the FIR_ filter using the transform method.
    
   :REC:  Apply the FIR_ filter recursively.
    
   :file:  The name of the file containing the FIR_ filter.
    
ALTERNATE FORMS
---------------
DFT may be used in place of FFT_.

DEFAULT VALUES
--------------

  ``FIR FFT FIR``

DESCRIPTION
-----------
   The filter applied by this command must have been designed by using the DFIR
   interactive filter design program (see BUGS below).  The filter is applied
   using the transform method unless you request the recursive method or the
   number of data points is too large for the transform method.  These filters
   all have zero phase distortion but can produce precursors with impulsive
   signals.

ERROR MESSAGES
--------------
- 1301: No data files read in.
- 1306: Illegal operation on unevenly spaced file
- 1307: Illegal operation on spectral file
- 1601: File and filter sampling intervals not equal for

  - The filter must be designed using the same sampling rate as the data to be
    filtered.

- 1603: Inadequate memory to perform FIR_ filter.


WARNING MESSAGES
----------------
- 1602: Inadequate memory to perform FIR_ filter using DFT.

  - the recursive method will be used automatically.

LIMITATIONS
-----------
  Maximum number of data points for transform method is 4096.  The DFIR routine
  has since vanished, as this has not been used by the Seismologists at LLNL
  for some years.  1. See the author for information on the use of DFIR.  2. See
  Chapter 3 of Rabiner and Gold, Theory and Application of Digital Signal
  Processing, Prentice-Hall, 1975 for a discussion of FIR_ filters.
