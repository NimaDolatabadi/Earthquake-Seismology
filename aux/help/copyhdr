SUMMARY
-------
Copies header variables from one file in memory to all others.

SYNTAX
------

  ``COPYHDR {FROM name|n} hdrlist``

INPUT
-----
   :FROM name:  Copy header list from named file in memory.
    
   :FROM n:  Copy header list from numbered file in memory.
    
   :hdrlist:  Space delimited list of header variables to copy.

  ``COPYHDR FROM 1``

DESCRIPTION
-----------
   This command lets you copy the values of any SAC header variable from one
   file in memory to all of the remaining files in memory.  You can select which
   file you want to copy from.

EXAMPLES
--------
  Assume you are using PPK to mark several times in the header of a file called
  FILE1.  You are using the header variables T3 and T4.  To copy those same
  markers into files FILE2 and FILE3::

      u:  READ FILE1
      u:  PPK
      u:  ... use cursor to mark times T3 and T4.
      u:  READ MORE FILE2 FILE3
      u:  COPYHDR FROM 1 T3 T4

  In this next example, assume you have read in a large number of files and you
  want to copy the event location, EVLA and EVLO, from the file called ABC into
  all of the other headers.  This can be easily done by referencing the file by
  name not number::

      u:  COPYHDR FROM ABC STLA STLO
