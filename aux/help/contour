CONTOUR
+++++++

SUMMARY
-------
Produces contour plots of data in memory.

SYNTAX
------

  ``CONTOUR {ASPECT ON|OFF}``

INPUT
-----
   :ASPECT {ON}:  Turn aspect ratio option on.  When this option is on,
       the viewport of the contour plot will be adjusted to maintain the y
       to x aspect ratio of the data.
    
   :ASPECT OFF:  Turn aspect ratio option off.  When off, the full
       viewport is used.
    
DEFAULT VALUES
--------------

  ``CONTOUR  ASPECT  OFF``

DESCRIPTION
-----------
   This command can be used to produce a contour plot of the of any other
   two-dimensional array data, including the output of the SPECTROGRAM_ command.
   The SAC data plotted by this command must of of file type "XYZ" (SAC header
   variable IFTYPE set to "IXYZ").  Several commands control how the data is
   displayed: ZLEVELS_ for the spacing and number of contour levels, ZLINES_ for
   linestyles, ZLABELS_ for contour labeling, ZTICKS_ for directional tick marks,
   and ZCOLORS_ for line colors.  Depending upon the contouring options selected,
   two different contouring algorithms are used.  A fast scan method is used if
   no only solid linestyles are selected and no tick marks or labels are
   requested.  Otherwise, a slower method, where entire line segments are first
   assembled before they are drawn, is used.  You may want to use the fast scan
   method for a quick look at your data and then select other options for a
   final version.

EXAMPLES
--------
   In the first example (shown below) a file is read and contoured using
   default values.


   EXAMPLES (cont.): In this example, the same file is read and the header is
   listed to determine the range of the z data (DEPMIN and DEPMAX.) Only
   selected portions of the output from LISTHDR_ are shown.  A range of contour
   levels between 700 km and 1150 km and an increment of 25 km is selected.  A
   list of four linestyles is selected, starting with a solid line.  The list
   will be repeated for every four contour levels.  A title is defined and the
   contour plot was generated::

      u: READ MYDATA
      u: LISTHDR
      s: FILE: MYDATA
      s:      NPTS = 10000
      s:    IFTYPE = GENERAL XYZ (3-D) FILE
      s:    DEPMIN = 697.71
      s:    DEPMAX = 1154.4
      s:    NXSIZE = 100
      s:  XMINIMUM = 82574.
      s:  XMAXIMUM = 86992.
      s:    NYSIZE = 100
      s:  YMINIMUM = 0.47439E+06
      s:  YMAXIMUM = 0.47720E+06
      u: ZLEVELS RANGE 700 1150 INCREMENT 25
      u: ZLINES LIST 1 2 3 4
      u: TITLE 'Katmai topography from survey data [inc = 25 km]'
      u: CONTOUR

   

   The result of this example is shown in the figure below.


   EXAMPLES (cont.): In the final example, the same data is used but different
   display options are selected.  Integer labels are selected for every fourth
   contour level and "down" tick marks are selected for the contour levels in
   between.  Solid linestyles are used for all contour levels::

      u: READ MYDATA
      u: ZLEVELS RANGE 700 1150 INCREMENT 25
      u: ZLABELS ON LIST INT OFF OFF OFF
      u: ZTICKS ON LIST 0 -1 -1 -1
      u: ZLINES LIST 1
      u: TITLE 'Katmai topography from survey data [labels and ticks]'
      u: CONTOUR

   

   The result of this example is shown in the figure below.
