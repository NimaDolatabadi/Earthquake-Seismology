SYNTAX

  SPECTROGRAM options

   where options are one or more of the following

   :WINDOW: v

   :SLICE: v

   :ORDER: n

   :CBAR:    {ON|OFF}

   :Choose from: {SQRT|NLOG|LOG10|NOSCALING{

   :YMIN: v

   :YMAX: v

   :METHOD: {PDS|MEM|MLM}

   :Choose from: {COLOR|GRAY}

   :PRINT: {pname}


INPUT
-----
   :WINDOW v:  Set the sliding data window length in seconds to v.  This
       window length determines the size of the fft.
    
   :SLICE v:  Set the data slice interval in seconds to v.  A single
       spectrogram line is produced for each slice interval.
    
   :ORDER n:  Specifies the number of points in the autocorrelation
       function used to compute the spectral estimate.
    
   :CBAR {ON|OFF}:  Turn reference color bar on or off.
    
   :{SQRT|NLOG|LOG10|NOSCALING}:  Specify natural log, log base 10, or
       square root scaling of amplitudes.
    
   :YMIN v:  Specifies the minimum frequency to plot.
    
   :YMAX v:  Specifies the maximum frequency to plot.
    
   :METHOD {PDS|MEM|MLM}:  Specifies the type of spectral estimator used.
       MLM stands for maximum likelihood and MEM stands for maximum
       entropy spectral estimators, respectively.  See description and
       references below.
    
   :{COLOR|GRAY}:  Specifies a color or grayscale image.
    
   :PRINT {pname}:  Prints the resulting plot to the printer named in
       pname, or to the default printer if pname is not used.  (This
       makes use of the SGF_ capability.)

DESCRIPTION
-----------
  A spectrogram is computed by calculating power spectra of consecutive,
  possibly overlapping time windows of data and plotting the spectra side by
  side along a time axis.  The spectra are calculated from a truncated
  autocorrelation function using either the maximum likelihood method (MLM),
  maximum entropy method (MEM), or Power Density Spectral method (PDS).  In
  general, the high resolution, maximum likelihood and maximum entropy methods
  are preferred because they improve resolution and because they do not produce
  artifacts (sidelobes) in the spectra due leakage of energy between different
  frequencies.  Descriptions of these techniques can be found in Kanasewich
  (1981) and Lacoss (1971) and the references therein.   The length of the
  truncated autocorrelation function is determined by the order parameter.  To
  maintain consistency with the spe subroutines we have set the defaults order
  to 200 for the power density spectra (pds) and 100 for the maximum entropy
  and maximum likelihood spectral estimates.   In sac the length of each data
  window is determined by the window parameter.  The spacing between spectra
  along the spectrograms time axis is determined by the slice parameter.  The
  difference between these two parameters determines the amount of overlap
  between adjacent time window as indicated in the diagram below.::

   Time --->
   0     1     2     3     4     5     6     7     8     9    10    11
   |.....|.....|.....|.....|.....|.....|.....|.....|.....|.....|.....|
   |__^__| window 1, First time will be at the center of this window.
         |__^__| window 2
               |__^__| window 3

   |.....| Slice: Difference between the start times of adjacent windows.
   
  The start and end points on the spectrograms time axis depend on the length
  of the time series being analysed and the window and slice parameters.
  The spectrogram's start time is one-half a window later than the time series
  start time because it is defined as the center of time of the first window.
  SAC doesn't pad the start of the data with zeros.

LIMITATIONS
-----------
  The size of the image in the frequency direction is 512.


PROBLEMS
--------
  There is currently very little error checking of the headers to
  make sure that they are from the same component and are contiguous in time.
  This will be corrected in the future.
