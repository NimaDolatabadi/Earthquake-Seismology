GRAYSCALE
+++++++++

SUMMARY
-------
Produces grayscale images of data in memory.

SYNTAX
------

  ``GRAYSCALE {options}``

   where options are one or more of the following:

  ``VIDEOTYPE NORMAL|REVERSED``

  ``SCALE v``

  ``ZOOM n``

  ``XCROP n1 n2|ON|OFF``

  ``YCROP n1 n2|ON|OFF``


  **SPECIAL NOTE** This command uses executables that are not distributed 
  with SAC. To use this command you must first install the Utah Raster 
  Toolkit.  The Utah Raster Toolkit can be obtained via anonymous FTP 
  as follows::

   ftp cs.utah.edu
   cd pub
   get urt-3.0.tar.Z

  If ARPAnet is not available, or if you have questions about the Utah Raster
  Toolkit, send mail to: toolkit-request\CS.UTAH.EDU (ARPA), OR
  {ihnp4,decvax}!utah-cs!toolkit-request (UUCP).

INPUT
-----
   :VIDEO NORMAL:  Set video type to normal. In normal mode, data with
       near minimum values are black and data near maximum are white.
    
   :VIDEO REVERSED:  Set video type to reversed. In reversed mode, data
       with near minimum values are white and data near maximum are black.
    
    
   :SCALE v:  Change data scaling factor to v.  The data is scaled by
       raising it to the vth power.  Values less than one will smooth the
       image, reducing peaks and valleys. Values greater than one will
       spread the data.
    
   :ZOOM n:  Image is increased to n times its normal size by pixel
       replication.
    
   :XCROP n1 n2:  Turn x cropping option on and change cropping limits to
       n1 and n2. The limits are in terms of the image size.
    
   :XCROP {ON}:  Turn x cropping option on and use previously specified
       cropping limits.
    
   :XCROP OFF:  Turn x cropping option off.  All of the data in the x
       direction is displayed.
    
   :YCROP n1 n2:  Turn y cropping option on and change cropping limits to
       n1 and n2. The limits are in terms of the image size.
    
   :YCROP {ON}:  Turn y cropping option on and use previous specified
       cropping limits.
    
   :YCROP OFF:  Turn y cropping option off.  All of the data in the y
       direction is displayed.

DESCRIPTION
-----------
   This command can be used to produce a grayscale image of the output of the
   SPECTROGRAM_ command or of any other two-dimensional array data.  The SAC 
   data displayed by this command must of of file type "xyz".

   ANOTHER SPECIAL NOTE: SAC starts a shell script which runs the image
   manipulation and display programs and then displays the SAC prompt again.
   There is a delay, significant for large images and/or slower machines, before
   the image is actually displayed.


LIMITATIONS
----------- 
 Images of 512 by 1000 are the maximum displayed.


ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
----------------
  This command was developed by Terri Quinn.  The grayscale
  images are maninpulated and display using the University of Utah's Raster
  Toolkit.  The Utah Raster Toolkit and accompanying documentation; John W.
  Peterson, Rod G. Bogart, and Spencer W. Thomas.
