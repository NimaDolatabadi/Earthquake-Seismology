BEGINFRAME
++++++++++

SUMMARY
-------
Turns off automatic new frame actions between plots.

SYNTAX
------

  ``BEGINFRAME {PRINT {pname} }``

INPUT
-----
   :PRINT {pname}:  When PRINT_ is used with BEGINFRAME_, it signals the
       assocated call to ENDFRAME_ to print the resulting plot to the
       printer named in pname, or to the default printer if pname is
       not used.  (This makes use of the SGF_ capability.)
    
    
ALTERNATE FORMS
---------------
BEGFR is an obsolete but allowable form of this command.

DESCRIPTION
-----------
   A "new frame action" is defined as the clearing of the current graphics
   display surface.  Specifically it is:

 - the erasing of the screen for a graphics terminal.

 - the closing of the current file for the SGF_ device driver.

 - the erasing of the current graphics window on a multi-window workstation.

 - the advancing of the film one frame for a film device.

 - the movement of the paper to a new area on a pen plotter.

   Normally SAC does a new frame action before each new plot (PLOT, PLOT1_, etc.)
   SAC stops doing this new frame action when the BEGINFRAME_ command is
   executed.  It resumes automatic framing when the ENDFRAME_ command is executed.
   Therefore, all plot commands executed between these two commands will have
   their output placed on the same frame.  By changing the viewport (XVPORT,
   YVPORT) between plot commands, by changing some of the various plot options,
   and by reading in different sets of data files, fairly complicated plots with
   multiple images can be easily generated.  See the example and figure below.
   You MUST execute the ENDFRAME_ command to discontinue this mode and to resume
   automatic framing between plots.

EXAMPLES
--------
   The plot that follows was generated using the set of commands shown below.
   Comments about the process are given in parenthesis::

      u:  CUT A -0.2 N 512        (set up cut and read file)
      u:  READ FILE1
      u:  BEGINFRAME          (turn off automatic framing)
      u:  XVPORT .1 .9        (define viewport and options)
      u:  YVPORT .7 .9
      u:  TITLE 'SEISMIC TRACE'
      u:  FILEID OFF          (turn off fileid and qdp option)
      u:  QDP OFF
      u:  PLOT                (plot the trace)
      u:  FFT WMEAN           (take transform of data)
      u:  XVPORT .1 .45       (second viewport and options)
      u:  YVPORT .15 .55
      u:  TITLE 'Amplitude Response (linlog)'
      u:  YLIM 1E-5 1
      u:  PLOTSP AM LINLOG    (plot the amplitude)
      u:  XVPORT .55 .9       (third viewport and options)
      u:  TITLE 'Amplitude Response (loglog)'
      u:  XLIM 1 60
      u:  PLOTSP AM LOGLOG    (plot amplitude again)
      u:  ENDFRAME            (resume automatic framing)
      u:  CUT OFF             (reset parameters used to default values)
      u:  FILEID ON
      u:  XLIM OFF
      u:  YLIM OFF

   

   The last four commands reset some of the parameters used in this operation to
   their default values.  This is a good habit to get into, especially when
   writing macros, as a way of avoiding the problem of one macro effecting the
   operation of others that follow.
