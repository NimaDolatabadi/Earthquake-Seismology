SYNTAX
------

  ``PLOTXY name|number  name|number  { name|number ... }``

INPUT

   :name:  The name of a data file in the data file list.
    
   :number:  The number of a data file in the data file list.
    
DESCRIPTION
-----------
   This command lets you plot one or more data files versus another data
   file.  The first data file you select (either by name or number) becomes the
   independent variable and is plotted along the x axis.  The remainder of the
   data files you select become the dependent variables and are plotted along
   the y axis.  All of the graphics environment commands such as TITLE_, LINE_,
   and SYMBOL_ can be used to control attributes about the plot.
   This command can be used to easily plot multi-columned data that has
   been read in with the READALPHA command.  In this case it can be viewed as a
   spreadsheet like plotting command.  An example is given below.

EXAMPLES
--------
  Assume you have an ascii file that contains four columns of numbers.  You
  wish to read these into SAC and plot various columns versus each other.  The
  following commands would read this file in and store it as four separate data
  files inside SAC, turn linestyle incrementing on and then plot the first,
  third, and fourth columns versus the second column::

      u: READALPHA CONTENT YNNN MYFILE
      u: LINE INCREMENT ON
      u: PLOTXY 2 1 3 4
