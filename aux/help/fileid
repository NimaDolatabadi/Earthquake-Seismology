DESCRIPTION

  This command controls the file id that is displayed on most SAC plot formats.
  The file id identifies the content of the plot.  The default file id consists
  of the event name, the station name and component, and the zero date and time.
  The name of the file can be substituted for the default id if desired.  A
  special file id can be defined and displayed.  This special file id can
  consist of up to 10 SAC header fields.  The location and format of the fileid
  can also be changed.

EXAMPLES
--------
  To put the filename in the upper left corner::

      u:  FILEID LOCATION UL TYPE NAME

  To define a special file id consisting of the station component, latitude,
  and longitude::

      u:  FILEID TYPE LIST KSTCMP STLA STLO

  To include the name of the header field followed by a colon::

      u:  FILEID FORMAT COLON
