PLOTPM
++++++

SUMMARY
-------
Generates a "particle-motion" plot of pairs of data files.

SYNTAX
------

  ``PLOTPM {PRINT {pname} }``

INPUT
-----
   :PRINT {pname}:  Print the resultant plot.  If a printer name is
       specified, print to that printer, else use default printer.
    
    
DESCRIPTION
-----------
  In a particle-motion plot one evenly spaced file is plotted against
  another.  For each value of the independent variable, normally time, the value
  of the dependent variable of the first file is plotted along the y axis and
  the value of the dependent variable of the second file is plotted along the x
  axis.  For a pair of seismograms this type of plot shows the motion of a
  "particle" in the plane of the two seismograms as a function of time.
  A square plot is generated, with the limits along each axis being the
  minimum and maximum values of the dependent variable.  Annotated axes are
  generated along the bottom and left.  Axes labels and title can be set by the
  XAXIS, YAXIS, and TITLE_ commands.  If no x and y axis labels are set, 
  then the name and azimuth of the station are used as axes labels.  
  The XLIM_ command can be used to control how much of each file to plot.

EXAMPLES
--------
  To create a particle-motion plot of two seismograms, XYZ.T and XYZ.R and set
  up your own axes labels and title::

      u:  READ XYZ.T XYZ.R
      u:  XLABEL 'Radial component'
      u:  YLABEL 'Transverse component'
      u:  TITLE 'Particle-motion plot for station XYZ'
      u:  PLOTPM

  If you wanted to plot only a small part of each file around the first arrival
  time, you could use the XLIM_ command::

      u:  XLIM A -0.2 2.0
      u:  PLOTPM

  You could also use PLOTPK_, possibly in a different graphics window as in this
  example, to mark which portion of the files you wanted to see in the particle
  motion plot::

      u:  BEGINWINDOW 2
      u:  PLOTPK
      u:  ... mark the portion you want using X and S
      u:  ... terminate PLOTPK with a Q
      u:  BEGINWINDOW 1
      u:  PLOTPM
