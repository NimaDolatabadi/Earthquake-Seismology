CUT
+++

SUMMARY
-------
Defines how much of a data file is to be read.

SYNTAX
------

  ``CUT {ON|OFF|pdw|SIGNAL}``

INPUT
-----
   :ON:  Turn cut option on but don't change pdw.
    
   :OFF:  Turn cut option off.
    
   :pdw:  Turn cut option on and change pdw.  A pdw is a partial data
       window.  It consists of a starting and a stopping value of the
       independent variable, usually time, which defines which part of a
   :file you wish to read.  The most general form of this pdw is:
       ref offset ref offset
    
   :ref:  A reference value, one of the following:
       Z|B|E|O|A|F|N|Tn, where n=0,1...9.
       The meanings of these names are given below.
    
   :offset:  A positive or negative number which is added to the
       reference value.
    
   :SIGNAL:  Equivalent to typing:  A -1 F +1.
    
DEFAULT VALUES
--------------

  ``OFF``


DESCRIPTION
-----------
   Cut option is off.  If the start or stop offset is omitted it is assumed to be
   zero.  If the start reference value is omitted it is assumed to be Z.  If the
   stop reference value is omitted it is assumed to be the same as the start
   reference value.

   With the cut option off, the entire file is read.  With it on, only that
   portion of the file between the starting and stopping cut values is read.
   These are values in terms of the independent variable in the data file,
   normally time.  See the section on "Data File Structure" in the Users Manual
   for a discussion of dependent and independent variables.  The following
   mnemonics are used to represent certain values of the independent variable:

   :B: Disk file beginning value.

   :E: Disk file ending value.

   :Z: Zero.

   :N: Interpret offset in terms of number of data points not independent variable. 
       Only used for stop values.

   The following mnemonics refer to reference values stored in the SAC
   header and are used primarily to cut time files:

   :O: Event origin time.

   :A: First arrival time.

   :F: Signal ending time.

   :Tn: User defined time picks, n = 0,1...9

   The above mnemonics plus an optional positive or negative offset define
   either a starting or stopping value.  O, A, F, and Tn can be defined for a
   given data file using the CHNHDR_ command.  A and F can also be defined using
   the automatic picker (APK) or manual pick plot (PLOTPK) commands.
   If you want to select the same time window from a group of data files
   that have different reference times, you must use the SYNCHRONIZE_ command
   before executing the CUT_ and READ_ commands.  SYNCHRONIZE_ modifies the headers
   so that each file has the same reference time.  It also adjusts all of the
   relative times, including B and E.  Then when the files are cut, they will
   have the same time window.  Since CUT_ is applied to the headers on disk, you
   must use the WRITEHDR_ command after the SYNCHRONIZE_ command and before the
   READ_ command to get the correct results.
   
EXAMPLES
--------
   In these examples we assume time is the independent variable and seconds are
   the units::

      u: B E -- Disk begin to disk end---same as turning cut off.
      u: B 0 30 -- First 30 secs of the disk file.
      u: A -10 30 -- From 10 secs before to 30 secs after first arrival.
      u: B N 2048 --  First 2048 points of disk file.
      u: 30.2 48 -- From 30.2 to 48 secs relative to disk file zero.

   You can also pad the beginning or end of a file with zeros by turning
   on the FILLZ option in the CUTERR_ command, defining a cut that extends
   beyond the current limits of the file, and then reading the file into memory 
   using the READ_ command.
   
     SAC> r N11A.lhz
     SAC> lh npts
  
       FILE: N11A.lhz - 1
       npts = 3101

     SAC> cuterr fillz; cut b n 4096
     SAC> r
     SAC> lh npts
  
       FILE: N11A.lhz - 1
       npts = 4096

     SAC> 

ERROR MESSAGES
--------------
- 1322: Undefined starting cut for file

  - undefined reference value in the header record.
  - this error can be controlled by use of CUTERR_ command.
  - when this error is off, the disk begin value is used.

- 1323: Undefined stop cut for file

  - undefined reference value in the header record.
  - this error can be controlled by use of CUTERR_ command.
  - when this error is off, the disk end value is used.

- 1324: Start cut less than file begin for file

  - bad CUT_ parameters.
  - this error can be controlled by use of CUTERR_ command.
  - when this error is off, the disk begin value is used or zeros are 
    insertedat the beginning of the data.

- 1325: Stop cut greater than file end for file

  - bad CUT_ parameters.
  - this error can be controlled by use of CUTERR_ command.
  - when this error is off, the disk end value is used or zeros are inserted 
    at the end of the data.

- 1326: Start cut greater than file end for file

  - bad CUT_ parameters.
  - this error cannot be turned off.


   SPECIAL NOTE: Since this is a parameter-setting command, the above errors
   will not appear until the READ_ command is executed.  Also, some of the above
   errors can be converted to warnings by the use of the CUTERR_ command.

LIMITATIONS
-----------
There is currently no provision for cutting unevenly-spaced files or spectral
files.
