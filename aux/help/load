SUMMARY
-------
Load an external command.

external commands and load require extra work in the linux version of SAC.

SYNTAX
------

  ``LOAD comname {ABBREV abbrevname}``

INPUT
-----
   :comname:  The name of an external function to load from a shared object.
    
   :ABBREV abbrevname:  An abbreviation or alias for comname.
    
DESCRIPTION
-----------
   This command allows the user to load commands written to the SAC external
   command interface specification (See EXTERNAL_INTERFACE_ help page).  This
   command must be a function stored in a shared object library ( a .so file-
   see UNIX LD manpage for details ).  SAC will look in all shared object
   libraries listed in environmental variable SACSOLIST.  This environmental
   variable should contain one or more names of shared objects in a blank
   delimited list.  The path to these shared objects must be specified in the
   LD_LIBRARY_PATH environmental variable.  If SACSOLIST is not set, then SAC
   will look for a shared object library called libsac.so, using the paths
   specified in LD_LIBRARY_PATH.  A library called libcom.so is distributed
   with SAC (see EXTERNAL COMMAND . below).

EXAMPLE
-------
  Set up your environment to have SAC look in the current directory for a
  command named foo from a shared object called libbar.so.  Set up an
  alias for foo called myfft.::

    % setenv SACSOLIST "libcom.so libbar.so"
    #  Add the current directory to the search path.
    % setenv LD_LIBRARY_PATH {$LD_LIBRARY_PATH}:. 

    % sac
    SAC> load foo abbrev myfft         * load the command
    SAC> read file1.z file2.z file3.z  * input files to pass to the command
    SAC> myfft real-imag               * invoke command with its arguments,
                                       * commands must parse their own args.

  How to create a shared object library containing your command(s):
  Solaris::

    cc -o libxxx.so -G extern.c foo.c bar.c

  SGI::

    cc -g -o libxxx.so -shared foo.c bar.c

  LINUX: (gcc)::

    gcc -o libxxx.so -shared extern.c foo.c bar.c sac.a

  where sac.a is the sac library available where you got sac.

EXTERNAL COMMAND INCLUDED IN THE DISTRIBUTION OF SAC
----------------------------------------------------
  There is one external command which is distributed with SAC.  It is called
  FLIPXY.  FLIPXY takes as input one or more X-Y datafiles, and transposes
  the data.  This command is in libcom.so in ${SACAUX}/external along with
  the source code of FLIPXY for reference.  To load FLIPXY, libcom.so must
  be included in SACSOLIST.

ERRORS
------
- 1028:  External command does not exist:
  This means that SAC did not find your external command.

  This error can arise for a couple of reasons.  One possibility is that your
  LD_LIBRARY_PATH environmental variable does not contain the path to your 
  shared library.  Another possibility is that you have not set your 
  SACSOLIST environmental variable to contain the names of your 
  shared libraries.
