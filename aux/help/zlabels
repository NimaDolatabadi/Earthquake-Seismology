ZLABELS
+++++++

SUMMARY
-------
Controls the labeling of contour lines with contour level values.

SYNTAX
------

  ``ZLABELS  {ON|OFF}  {options}``

   where options are one or more of the following:

  ``SPACING v1 {v2 {v3} }``

  ``SIZE v``

  ``ANGLE v``

  ``LIST c1 c2 ... cn``

  **SPECIAL NOTE** The LIST option must appear last in this command.

INPUT
-----
   :ON:  Turn labeling of contour lines on.
    
   :OFF:  Turn labeling of contour lines off.
    
   :SPACING v1 {v2 {v3} }:  Set the minimum, optimum, and maximum spacing
       between adjacent labels (in viewport coordinates) to v1, v2, and v3
       respectively.  If the second or third values are omitted, the
       previous values are used.
    
   :SIZE v:  Set the size (height) of the labels (in viewport
       coordinates) to v.
    
   :ANGLE v:  Set the desired maximum text angle the labels (in degrees
       from horizontal) to v.
    
   :LIST c1 c2 . cn:  Set the list of contour labels to use.  Each entry
       in this list is used for the corresponding contour level.  If the
       number of contour levels is larger than the length of this list,
       the entire list is repeated.
    
   :cn:  ON|OFF|INT|FLOATn|EXPn|text
    
   :ON:  Place a label on corresponding contour line. Use Fortran's free
       format capabilities to format the label from the contour level
       value.
    
   :OFF:  Do not place a label on corresponding contour line.
    
   :INT:  Place an integer label on corresponding contour line.
    
   :FLOATn:  Place a floating point label on corresponding contour line
       with n values to the right of the decimal point. If n is omitted,
       the previous value for n is used.
    
   :EXPn:  Place an exponentially formatted label on corresponding
       contour line with n values to the right of the decimal point. If n
       is omitted, the previous value for n is used.
    
   :text:  Use text to label the corresponding contour line.
