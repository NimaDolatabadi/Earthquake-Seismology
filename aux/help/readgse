READGSE
+++++++

SUMMARY
-------
  Read data files in GSE 2.0 format from disk into memory.

  Note:  GSE data enters SAC via SAC's CSS data buffers.  To understand how
  arrivals are handled, use HELP_ READCSS_ and HELP_ PICKPREFS_.


SYNTAX
------

  ``READGSE {MAXMEM v} {MORE} {VERBOSE ON|OFF} {SHIFT ON|OFF}``

  ``{SCALE ON|OFF} {COMMIT|ROLLBACK|RECALLTRACE} {DIR name} filelist``



INPUT
-----
   :MAXMEM: Specify the maximum fraction of physical memory to use when
       reading large data sets. When this limit is reached, no more
       waveforms will be read, although other tables may still be read.
       The default value for MAXMEM is 0.3.
    
   :MORE:  See the READ_ command.
    
   :VERBOSE ON|OFF: If VERBOSE is ON, SAC displays extended information
       about the waveforms being read, and prints a summary of the CSS
       tables that were filled. SAC also displays a progress indicator
       for the conversion to SAC internal format.
    
   :Note:  the SHIFT option is moot at this point.  For the time being,
       origin information is not read because it cannot be
       associated with a waveform.  The release of GSE 2.1 format
       should allow us to make the association, then we will be
       able to read origin, and the SHIFT option will have meaning. 
   :SHIFT ON|OFF:  If SHIFT is on, the origin time is set to zero, and
       other time related header variables are shifted back to be
       consistent with the origin time.  Some of the distance related
       header variables are also affected.  SHIFT ON is the default.
    
   :SCALE ON|OFF:  The SCALE option is OFF by default.
       When SCALE is OFF, SAC reads the counts from the GSE file.  When
       SCALE is ON, SAC multiplies counts by a SCALE factor given as
       CALIB in the GSE file.  This scale option changes with the
       SCALE options of READ_ SEGY, READCSS_, and READSUDS_.
       If SCALE is OFF, the CALIB value from the file will be stored
       in SAC's SCALE header variable.  If SCALE is on, SAC's SCALE
       header field is set to 1.0.
       SCALE is a crude method of accounting for the instrument
       response.  The prefered method is with the TRANSFER_ command.
       It is recommended to leave SCALE off for the READ_ and use
       the TRANSFER_ command.  SCALE should really only be used
       if the response information necessary for the TRANSFER_ command
       is not available.
    
   :COMMIT:  If the MORE option is specified, the COMMIT option commits
       headers and waveforms in SAC memory -- removing any previous
       versions of headers or waveforms from RAM -- prior to
       reading more files.  COMMIT is the default.
    
   :ROLLBACK:  If the MORE option is specified, the ROLLBACK option reverts
       to the last committed version of the header and waveform
       before reading more files.
    
   :RECALLTRACE:  If the MORE option is specified, the RECALLTRACE option:

       - reverts to the last committed version of the waveform,
       - reverts to the last committed version of those header
       	 variables closely linked to the waveform,
       - commits those header variables which are loosely linked
       	 to the waveform. (use HELP_ RECALLTRACE for a list of which 
	 header variables are committed, and which are rolled back.)
    
   :Note:  if the MORE option is not specified, the COMMIT, ROLLBACK,
       and RECALLTRACE options have no effect.
    
   :DIR name:  The directory to be searched for gsefile(s).
    
   :filelist:  The name(s) of one or more gse files.
    
DEFAULT VALUES
--------------

  ``READGSE * MAXMEM 0.3 VERBOSE OFF COMMIT``

DESCRIPTION
-----------
   See the READ_ command.  October 27, 1998 (Version 00.58)

   Any command which loads data into memory is monitored to maintain a
   level of confidence in the event infomation when transfered from the SAC
   data buffer to the CSS data buffer.  When READGSE_ is used, the confidence
   is set to LOW, indicating that SAC should consider any matching event IDs
   as artifacts and reassign the event ID of the incoming file.  For more
   details, use HELP_ READ_.


NOTES
-----

  The following GSE Data messages can be read:

  - WAVEFORM
  - STATION
  - CHANNEL
  - ARRIVAL

  Waveform formats of INT, CM6, and CM8 can be read.

  Arrivals, although read, will not appear in SAC since the DETECTIONS message
  is not yet read, and without a DETECTION ID, arrivals cannot be associated
  with channels.
