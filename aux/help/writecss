WRITECSS
++++++++

SUMMARY
-------
Writes data in memory to disk in CSS 3.0 format.

SYNTAX
------

  ``WRITE {BINARY|ASCII} {COMMIT|ROLLBACK|RECALLTRACE}``

  ``{DIR ON|OFF|CURRENT|name} name``

INPUT
-----
   :ASCII:  (Default) Write standard ASCII flatfiles.
    
   :BINARY: Write output as a single CSS 3.0 binary file.
    
   :COMMIT:  The COMMIT option commits headers and waveforms in SAC
       memory prior to writing the traces. COMMIT is the default.
    
   :ROLLBACK:  The ROLLBACK option reverts to the last committed version
       of the header and waveform before writing the traces.
    
   :RECALLTRACE:  The RECALLTRACE option:

       - reverts to the last committed version of the waveform,
       - reverts to the last committed version of those header
       	 variables closely linked to the waveform,
       - commits those header variables which are loosely linked
         to the waveform before writing the traces.
       	 (use HELP_ RECALLTRACE for a list of which header variables are
       	 committed, and which are rolled back.)
    
   :DIR ON:  Turn directory option on but don't change name of write
       directory.
    
   :DIR OFF:  Turn directory option off.  When off, writes to current
       directory.
    
   :DIR CURRENT:  Turn directory option on and set name of write
       directory to the "current directory" (e.g. the directory from which
       you started SAC.)
    
   :DIR name:  Turn directory option on and set name of write directory
       to name.  Write all files to the directory called name.  This
       may be a relative or absolute directory name.
    
   :name:  Write filelist in set to name.  There should be only
       one name specified.  It may not contain wildcards. For ASCII
       output, name will be prepended to the table name for each
       flatfile. (i.e. name.wfdisc, name.origin, ...). In BINARY
       mode, name is the output file name.
    
DEFAULT VALUES
--------------

  ``WRITECSS ASCII COMMIT DIR OFF``

DESCRIPTION
-----------

   This command allows you, at any point in the processing of data, to
   save the results to disk in CSS 3.0 format.  In ASCII mode (default) one
   or more ASCII flatfiles are written. The exact files written will depend
   upon the source of the data but can be any of:

   wfdisc, wftag, origin, arrival, assoc, sitechan, site, affiliation,
   origerr, origin, event, sensor, instrument, gregion, stassoc, remark
   sacdata.

   In Binary mode a single file will be written containing the same set
   of tables as would be written in ASCII mode, but with all tables in
   binary format and with the waveform data embedded in the file.

   For more information on the CSS format see the "Center for Seismic Studies
   Version 3 Database:  Schema Reference Manual".

ERROR MESSAGES
--------------
- 1301: No data files read in.
- 1311: No list of filenames to write.
- 1312: Bad number of files in write file list
