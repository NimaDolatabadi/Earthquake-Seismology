MERGE
+++++

SUMMARY
-------
Merges (concantenates) a set of files to data in memory.

SYNTAX
------

  ``MERGE {VERBOSE} {GAP ZERO|INTERP} {OVERLAP COMPARE|AVERAGE} {filelist}``

INPUT
-----
    
   :GAP ZERO | INTERP: How to handle data gaps
       ZERO - Fill with 0.0 amplitude
       INTERP - Interpolate, linear, within the data gap 

   :OVERLAP COMPARE | AVERAGE: How to handle data overlaps
       COMPARE - Compare overlapping data points, exit on mismatch
       AVERAGE - Average overlapping data points

   :VERBOSE: Describe the merge details

   :filelist:  A list of SAC binary data files.  This list may contain
       simple filenames, full or relative pathnames, and wildcard
       characters.  See the READ_ command for a complete description.
    

DESCRIPTION
-----------
   The data in the files in this merge list is appended or concantenated to the
   data in memory.  Each pair of files to be merged is checked to make sure they
   have the same sampling interval and station name.  Any number of file, in any
   order are able to be merged.  Data currently in memory and data identified in
   the merge command are merged together.  If no data is specified with the merge
   command, data currently in memory will be merged. 

EXAMPLES
--------
   To merge FILE3, FILE4, FILE1 and FILE2 into one file::

      u:  READ FILE1 FILE2
      u:  MERGE FILE3 FILE4

   or
      
      u: READ FILE1 FILE2 FILE3 FILE4
      u: MERGE

   or
      
      u: DELETECHANNEL ALL
      u: MERGE FILE1 FILE2 FILE3 FILE4

   To merge files for the same station, say ELKO.Z, from four different events
   each stored in a separate UNIX directory::

      u:  READ data/event1/elko.z
      u:  MERGE data/event2/elko.z data/event3/elko.z data/event4/elko.z
