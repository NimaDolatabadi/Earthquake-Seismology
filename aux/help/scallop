SCALLOP
+++++++

Note:  This command has been renamed SONOGRAM_ (SONO).  Either command,
SONOGRAM_ or SCALLOP_, will do the same thing.

SUMMARY
-------
Calculate a spectrogram equal to the difference between two smoothed versions
of the same spectrogram.

SYNTAX
------

  ``SCALLOP options``

   where options are one or more of the following:

  ``WINDOW v``

  ``SLICE v``

  ``ORDER n``

  ``CBAR    {ON|OFF}``

  ``YMIN v``

  ``YMAX v``

  ``FMIN v``

  ``FMAX v``

  ``BINARY|FULL``

  ``METHOD {PDS|MEM|MLM}``

  ``{COLOR|GRAY}``

  ``PRINT {pname}``

INPUT
-----
   :WINDOW v:  Set the sliding data window length in seconds to v.  This
       window length determines the size of the fft.
    
   :SLICE v:  Set the data slice interval in seconds to v.  A single
       spectrogram line is produced for each slice interval.
    
   :ORDER n:  Specifies the number of points in the autocorrelation
       function used to compute the spectral estimate.
    
   :CBAR {ON|OFF}:  Turn reference color bar on or off.
    
   :BINARY|FULL:  Produce a binary image, or a full color image.
    
   :YMIN v:  Specifies the minimum frequency to plot.
    
   :YMAX v:  Specifies the maximum frequency to plot.
    
   :FMIN v:  Specifies the smallest bandwidth over which each slice in
       the spectrogram will be smoothed.
    
   :FMAX v:  Specifies the maximum bandwidth over which each slice in the
       spectrogram will be smoothed.
    
   :METHOD {PDS|MEM|MLM}:  Specifies the type of spectral estimator used.
       MLM stands for maximum likelihood and MEM stands for maximum
       entropy spectral estimators, respectively.  See description and
       references below.
    
   :{COLOR|GRAY}:  Specifies a color or grayscale image.
    
   :PRINT {pname}:  Prints the resulting plot to the printer named in
       pname, or to the default printer if pname is not used.  (This
       makes use of the SGF_ capability.)
    
   
DEFAULT VALUES

 ``SCALLOP WINDOW 2 SLICE 1 METHOD MEM ORDER 100 YMIN 0 YMAX FNYQUIST FMIN 2.0``

 ``fmax 6.0 full color``

DESCRIPTION
-----------
  The scalloping command computes a spectrogram equal to the difference between
  two smoothed version of the same spectrogram.  Depending on the choice of
  smoothing parameters, fmin and fmax, the resulting spectrogram can enhance 
  small amplitude spectral features that are more difficult to observe in a
  conventional spectrogram.  This is particularly useful when looking for
  features like high frequency spectral modulations in seismic signals from
  mine blasts (c.f., Hedlin, 1990, Wuster, 1993).


LIMITATIONS
-----------
  The size of the image in the frequency direction is 512.

PROBLEMS
--------
  There is currently very little error checking of the headers to
  make sure that they are from the same component and are contiguous in time.
  This will be corrected in the future.
