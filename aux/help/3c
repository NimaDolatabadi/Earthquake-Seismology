3C
++

SUMMARY
-------
Launch a Matlab GUI for manipulating 3-component data.

SYNTAX
------

  ``3C options``
   where options are one or more of


  ``{AUTO}``

  ``{A,T0,T1,T2,T3,T4,T5,T6,T7,T8,T9}``

  ``{WINLEN value}``


DESCRIPTION
-----------
   3c identifies all 3-component channel sets in the files currently
   in memory. These channel sets are copied into a Matlab workspace and a GUI
   is launched. Within this GUI the user may obtain estimates of back azimuth,
   incidence angle, and polarization, rotate traces, make 3-D particle motion
   plots, pick phase arrivals, and do polarization analysis using maximum
   likelihood estimators. Back azimuth, incidence angle, and polarization
   estimates are returned in the SAC header variables USER0 (KUSER0), USER1
   (KUSER1), and USER2 (KUSER2). Picks are returned in T0 - T9 (KT0 - KT9).
   Instructions for using the GUI are available through a built-in help system
   in the GUI.

   When the AUTO option is specified, 3c does the polarization analysis
   without intervention using a window starting at the specified time marker
   {A,T0,T1,T2,T3,T4,T5,T6,T7,T8,T9}, and a window length of WINLEN.
