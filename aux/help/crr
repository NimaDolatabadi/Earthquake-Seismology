COMMIT , RECALLTRACE , ROLLBACK
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

SUMMARY
-------
ROLLBACK:    reverts SAC data to last committed version in I/O buffers.
COMMIT:      commits (copies) SAC data to the I/O buffers.
RECALLTRACE: rolls back the last committed waveform and a few header
fields, commits most of the header fields.

SYNTAX
------

  ``ROLLBACK``

  ``COMMIT``

  ``RECALLTRACE (or simply RECALL)``


DESCRIPTION
-----------
   Context:
   In order to support multiple data formats with as little information loss as
   possible, SAC's internal data storage has been augmented with I/O buffers
   based on the CSS 3.0 schema. Computations continue to be performed on the
   data stored in the original SAC-format headers, but most I/O takes place using
   the data stored in the I/O buffers.  Because there are two copies of the data
   in memory, and because most SAC commands do not affect the copy stored in the
   I/O buffers, SAC can revert to the copy in the I/O buffer to effectively erase
   unwanted changes without having to re-read the data.


ROLLBACK
--------
After a series of operations on the data you can issue the ROLLBACK command,
and the operations will be undone; the datafiles in SAC's internal data
storage are replaced with the corresponding files in the I/O buffer, which
represent the last committed version of the data files.

COMMIT
------
After a series of operations on the data you can issue the COMMIT command,
any changes to the header values and the waveforms will be copied from the
SAC headers to the I/O buffers.  Future ROLLBACK commands will revert to this
committed data.

RECALLTRACE
-----------
The RECALLTRACE command:
  - rolls back the waveforms
  - rolls back those header variables which are tightly linked to the waveforms
  - commits those variables which are loosely linked to the waveforms.

This allows the user the flexibility to read a file, filter it, process it,
and change some of the header variables not tightly linked to the waveform
(make picks, establish new event location, etc.) and then recall the original
waveform while saving the new header values.  The user need not worry about
ending up with header variables which are inconsistent with the waveform,
because RECALLTRACE will roll those variables back with the waveform.

The following header variables are considered tightly linked to the waveform:
DELTA	ODELTA	DEPMIN	DEPMAX	DEPMEN	STLA	STLO	STEL	STDP
CMPAZ	CMPINC	XMINIMUM	XMAXIMUM	YMINIMUM	YMAXIMUM
NPTS	NXSIZE	NYSIZE	NVHDR	NORID	NEVID	NWFID
IFTYPE	IDEP	IINST	ISTREG	IZTYPE	ISYNTH	LEVEN	LPSPOL
KSTNM	KINST	KCMPNM	KHOLE	KNETWK


The following header variables are considered loosely linked to the waveform:
B	E	O	A	T0	T1	T2	T3
T4	T5	T6	T7	T8	T9	F	EVLA
EVLO	EVEL	EVDP	MAG	USER0	USER1	USER2	USER3
USER4	USER5	USER6	USER7	USER8	USER9	DIST	AZ
BAZ	GCARC	SCALE	RESP0	RESP1	RESP2	RESP3	RESP4
RESP5	RESP6	RESP7	RESP8	RESP9
NZYEAR	NZJDAY	NZHOUR	NZMIN	NZSEC	NZMSEC
IEVTYP	IMAGTYP	IMAGSRC	IEVREG	IQUAL	LOVROK	LCALDA
KDATRD	KEVNM	KO	KA	KT0	KT1	KT2	KT3
KT4	KT5	KT6	KT7	KT8	KT9	KF	KUSER0
KUSER1	KUSER2


EXAMPLES
--------

   The COMMIT command is used on the 14th line of the following example.
   Run the example three times:  the second time use ROLLBACK in place of COMMIT.
   The third time, use RECALLTRACE::

      u: FG SEIS
      u: RTR
      u: P1
      u: LH KSTNM KEVNM
      u: CH KSTNM KAH KEVNM SOMEEVENT
      u: ENVELOPE
      u: PPK
      u: user picks T1 at the change in frequency content
      u: P1
      u: LH KSTNM KEVNM
      u: COMMIT	# replace with ROLLBACK or RECALLTRACE as appropriate
      u: P1
      u: LH KSTNM KEVNM

   

RESULTS
-------
When running this example with the COMMIT command, the final P1 will
display the enveloped data and the T1 pick; the LH will display the
new values for KSTNM and KEVNM which were set with the CH command.

When running this example with the ROLLBACK command, the final P1 will
display the unprocessed file produced by the FG command and the T1 pick
will be lost; the LH will display the original values of KSTNM and KEVNM.

When running this example with the RECALLTRACE command, the final P1 will
display the unprocessed file produced by the FG command but the T1 pick will
be preserved; the LH will display the original value of KSTNM and the new
value of KEVNM.

------------
   DATAGEN_, DELETECHANNEL_, DELETESTACK, MERGE_, READ_, READALPHA, READCSS_,
   READGSE_, READHDR_, READSDD_, READSUDS_, SORT_, WRITE_, WRITECSS_,
   WRITEHDR_, WRITESP_, WRITESTACK



WARNING
-------
Certain SAC commands will automatically commit your data for you.
Because there are now two data storage locations, certain SAC commands
will require that the two sets of files be made consitent with each
other prior to executing the command.  The following commands require
consistency every time they are called,

MERGE_           SORT_            WRITE_           WRITECSS_
WRITEHDR_        WRITESP_         WRITESTACK

The following commands require consistency when the MORE option is
specified,

DATAGEN_         READ_            READALPHA       READCSS_
READGSE_         READHDR_         READSDD_        READSUDS_

These commands will by default commit the data before executing.  Each
of these commands takes options to allow it to rollback or recall the
data prior to execution.  The options are COMMIT_, ROLLBACK_, and
RECALLTRACE_.  COMMIT is the default. 

Changing the option in any one of these commands changes it in all
of them for future calls.



Note:	Because there are now two data storage locations, we optimized
flexibility of the DELETECHANNEL_ and DELETESTACK_ commands by allowing
the COMMIT option to control whether the datafiles are deleted from
the I/O buffers.  When either of these delete commands are used with
COMMIT ON, the specified data files are deleted from the I/O buffers
as well as the SAC internal data storage; subsequent ROLLBACK_ commands
will find no trace of the deleted files.  When one of these delete
commands is issued with COMMIT OFF, the specified datafiles are
deleted from the SAC internal data storage, but not from the I/O
buffers; subsequent calls to ROLLBACK will return these files to
the SAC internal data storage.  There is an exception:  when
DELETECHANNEL_ is called with the ALL option, all datafiles will be
deleted from SAC internal storage and the I/O buffers regardless of
the COMMIT_ option.  The default is COMMIT OFF.  See DELETECHANNEL_
and DELETESTACK_ for details.

Changing the COMMIT option in one delete command changes it in both
for future calls.  The COMMIT option for DELETECHANNEL and
DELETESTACK is unrelated to the COMMIT option in other commands
listed in the Warning above.
