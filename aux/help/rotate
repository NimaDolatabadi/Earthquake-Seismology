ROTATE
++++++

SUMMARY
-------
Rotates a pair of data components through an angle.

SYNTAX
------

  ``ROTATE {to GCP|TO v|THROUGH v|,{NORMAL|REVERSED}``

INPUT
-----
   :TO GCP:  Rotate to the "great circle path".  Both components must be
       horizontals.  The station and event coordinates header fields must
       be defined.
    
   :TO v:  Rotate to the angle v in degrees.  Both components must be
       horizontals.
    
   :THROUGH v:  Rotate through the angle v in degrees.  One component may
       be vertical.
    
   :NORMAL:  Output components with normal polarity.
    
   :REVERSED:  Output components with reversed polarity.
    
DEFAULT VALUES
--------------

  ``ROTATE TO GCP NORMAL``

DESCRIPTION
-----------
  Pairs of data components are rotated in this command.  Each pair must
  have the same station name, event name, and sampling rate.  In the THROUGH
  option both components are simply rotated through the requested angle.  One of
  those components may be a vertical.  Rotations in the horizontal plane are
  clockwise from north.  Rotations with a vertical component are clockwise from
  up.

  Both components must be horizontals when the TO option is used.  This
  means that CMPAZ must be definined and that CMPINC must be 90 degrees.  After
  the rotation is completed the first component of each pair will be directed
  along the angle given after to TO keyword.  If the TO GCP option is used this
  component will be directed along the angle given by the station-event back
  azimuth plus or minus 180 degrees.  This component therefore points from the
  event toward the station.  The station and event coordinates header fields
  (STLA, STLO, EVLA, and EVLO) must be defined so that the back azimuth can be
  calculated.

  The NORMAL and REVERSED options also apply only to horizontal rotations.
  If the NORMAL option is used the second component leads the first by 90
  degrees.  If the REVERSED option is used it lags the first by 90 degrees.

EXAMPLES
--------
  To rotate a pair of horizontals through 123.43 degrees::

      u: READ XYZ.N XYZ.E
      u: ROTATE TO 123.43

  To rotate two sets of horizontals to the great circle path::

      u: READ ABC.N ABC.E DEF.N DEF.E
      u: ROTATE TO GCP
      u: W ABC.R ABC.T DEF.R DEF.T

  In the above example if the BAZ header variable had been 33 degrees, the
  radial components would be at 213 degrees and the tangential components at
  303 degrees.  If reversed polarity had been requested the tangential
  components would be at 123 degrees.

HEADER CHANGES
--------------
  CMPAZ, CMPINC

ERROR MESSAGES
--------------
- 1301: No data files read in.
- 2001: Command requires an even number of data files.
- 2004: Insufficient header information for rotation:

  - STLA, STLO, EVLA, EVLO must be defined for GCP option.

- 2002: Following files are not an orthogonal pair:
- 2003: Following files are not both horizontals:

  - TO option only works on horizontals.
