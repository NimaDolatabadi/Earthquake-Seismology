DESCRIPTION
-----------
   This command lets you write a blackboard variable file to disk.  It can later
   be read into SAC using the READBBF_ command.  This feature lets you save
   information from one execution of SAC to another.  You can also add coding to
   your own programs to access the information in these blackboard variable
   files.  This lets you transfer information between your own programs and SAC.
   See the SAC Subroutines Reference Manual for details.
