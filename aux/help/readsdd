READSDD
+++++++

SUMMARY
-------
Reads data from SDD data files on disk into memory.

SYNTAX
------

  ``READSDD [options] [filelist]``

   where options is one or more of the following:

  ``MORE``

  ``COMMIT|ROLLBACK|RECALLTRACE``

  ``DIR CURRENT|name``


  ALL options MUST preceed any element in the filelist.

INPUT
-----
   :MORE:  Place the new data files in memory AFTER the old ones.  If this
       option is omitted, the new data files REPLACE the old ones.
    
   :Note:  if the MORE option is not specified, the COMMIT, ROLLBACK,
       and RECALLTRACE options have no effect.
    
   :COMMIT:  If the MORE option is specified, the COMMIT option commits
       headers and waveforms in SAC memory -- removing any previous
       versions of headers or waveforms from RAM -- prior to
       reading more files.  COMMIT is the default.
    
   :ROLLBACK:  If the MORE option is specified, the ROLLBACK option reverts
       to the last committed version of the header and waveform
       before reading more files.
    
   :RECALLTRACE:  If the MORE option is specified, the RECALLTRACE option:
 
       - reverts to the last committed version of the waveform,
       - reverts to the last committed version of those header
         variables closely linked to the waveform,
       - commits those header variables which are loosely linked
       	 to the waveform. (use HELP_ RECALLTRACE for a list of which 
	 header variables are committed, and which are rolled back.)
    
   :DIR CURRENT:  Read all simple filenames (with or without wildcards)
       from the current directory.  This is the directory from which you
       started SAC.
    
   :DIR name:  Read all simple filenames (with or without wildcards) from
       the directory called name.  This may be a relative or absolute
       directory name.
    
   :filelist:  file|wild .
    
   :file:  A legal filename.  This may be a simple filename or a pathname.
       The pathname can be a relative or absolute one.
    
   :wild:  A wildcard laden token that expands to a list of filenames.
       more details.
    
DEFAULT VALUES
--------------

  ``READ COMMIT DIR CURRENT``

DESCRIPTION
-----------
   All the same restrictions apply to READSDD_ as to the READ_ command.  See the
   READ_ command DESCRIPTION and EXAMPLES sections for more detail.

   Any command which loads data into memory is monitored to maintain a
   level of confidence in the event infomation when transfered from the SAC
   data buffer to the CSS data buffer.  When READSDD_ is used, the confidence
   is set to LOW, indicating that SAC should consider any matching event IDs
   as artifacts and reassign the event ID of the incoming file.  For more
   details, use HELP_ READ_.
