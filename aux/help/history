DESCRIPTION
-----------
   The history module provides a subset of the history capabilities
   available in the unix C-shell. Issuing the comand "history" will
   print a numbered list of the most recent commands (up to 100).
   Several of the event designators from the C-shell are also
   available. These are references to command lines in the history
   list. Available designators are:

   !    Start a history substitution, except when followed
   by a space character, tab, newline, = or (.

   !!   Repeat the previous command.
   !n   Repeat command line n.
   !-n  Repeat current command line minus n.
   !str Repeat the most  recent  command  starting  with str

EXAMPLES
--------
  To print the history list::

      u:  history

  To repeat command 1::

      u:  !1

  To repeat the last command::

      u:  !!

  To repeat the 2nd-to-last command::

      u:  !-2

  To repeat the command starting with ps::

      u:  !ps
