DESCRIPTION
-----------
   The image command allows the user to make color or grayscale images from a
   SAC 3-D data file such as those generated by the spectrogram, scallop, or
   bbfk commands.  It can also be used to plot imported data provided they are
   in the SAC 3-D data format.  Different sections of the image can be viewed
   using the xlim and ylim commands and amplitudes can be scaled using the 
   usual unary operations provided in SAC.
