CORRELATE
+++++++++

SUMMARY
-------
Computes the auto- and cross- correlation functions.

SYNTAX
------

  ``CORRELATE  {MASTER name|n},``

  ``{NUMBER n},{LENGTH ON|OFF|v},``

  ``{TYPE  RECTANGLE|HAMMING|HANNING|COSINE|TRIANGLE}``

INPUT
-----
   :MASTER name|n:  Select master file in data file list by name or
       number.  All files will be correlated against this one.
    
   :NUMBER n:  Set number of correlation windows to be used.
    
   :NORMALIZED: Results are normalized between -1.0 and 1.0
    
   :LENGTH {ON}:  Turn fixed window length option on.
    
   :LENGTH OFF:  Turn fixed window length option off.
    
   :LENGTH v:  Turn fixed window length option on and change window
       length in seconds to v.
    
   :TYPE RECTANGLE:  Apply a rectangle function to each window.  This is
       equivalent to applying no function to each window.
    
   :TYPE HAMMING:  Apply a hamming function to each window.
    
   :TYPE HANNING:  Apply a hanning function to each window.
    
   :TYPE COSINE:  Apply a cosine function to each window.
    
   :TYPE TRIANGLE:  Apply a triangle function to each window.

DESCRIPTION
-----------
  An auto-correlation function is computed on the signal which you declare
  to be the master one, and a cross-correlation function is calculated between
  it and each of the other signals in memory.

  The windowing features of this command allow you to compute an average
  correlation function over a set of data windows.  The number of windows is
  selectable and there are five standard windowing functions to choose from.
  When this windowing feature is on, a cross-correlation function is computed 
  for each window.  This collection of cross-correlation functions is then 
  averaged, cut to the same length as the original data file, and replaces 
  the data file in memory.  You may also select the length of each window.  

  Window overlap is automatically calculated and used whenever the product 
  of the requested window length (LENGTH option) and the number of windows 
  (NUMBER option) exceeds the number of points in the data file (NPTS).  
  By default, this windowing feature is off.

EXAMPLES
--------
  To calculate the correlation functions using the third file in memory
  as the master file::

      u:  CORRELATE MASTER 3

  You could also specify the master file by name if this is easier.
  Assume you have two data files that each contain 1000 points of noise.
  To compute the average correlation functions using 10 windows of 100 points
  each (i.e. no overlap) with a hanning function applied to each window::

      u:  CORRELATE TYPE HANNING NUMBER 10

  To achieve a twenty percent overlap of each window, set the window length to
  the equivalent of 120 data points.  Assuming a sampling interval of 0.025 (40
  samples per second) this would be three seconds as shown below::

      u:  CORRELATE TYPE HANNING NUMBER 10 LENGTH 3.0
