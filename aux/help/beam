BEAM
++++

SUMMARY
-------
Computes the beam using all data files in SAC memory.

SYNTAX
------

  ``BEAM {BEARING v} {VELOCITY v} {REFERENCE ON|OFF| lat lon {el} }``

  ``{OFFSET  REF|USER|STATION|EVENT|CASCADE}``

  ``{EC anginc survel} {CENTER x y z} {WRITE fname}``

INPUT
-----
   :BEARING v:  Bearing, in degrees from the north.
    
   :VELOCITY v:  Velocity, in kilometers per second.
    
   :[REF]ERENCE lat lon {el}:  Reference point.
       Turns REFERENCE option on and defines a reference point relative
       to which the offsets can be determined.
       (See OFFSET REF below)
    
   :lat: latitude.
   :lon: longitude.
   :el:  elevation (positive is down).
    
   :[REF]ERENCE ON|OFF: Turns REFERENCE option on or off.
       (See OFFSET REF below)
       Be careful not to use REFERENCE ON the first
       time this option is used with BEAM_ unless you
       really want the point where the prime maridian
       meets the equator.
    
   :OFFSET REF:	Offsets are determined relative to the reference
       point entered with the REFERENCE option.  This
       requires the REFERENCE option to be on.
    
   :OFFSET USER:	Offsets are taken directly from USER7, USER8, and
       USER9, (in the directions of latitude, longitude,
       and elevation, respectively).  This requires all
       the files to have defined values of USER7 and USER8.
       If the EC option is set, then OFFSET USER also
       requires that USER9 be set.
    
   :OFFSET STATION:	Offsets are determined relative to the location
       of the first station.  This requires all
       the files to have defined values of STLA and STLO.
    
   :OFFSET EVENT:	Offsets are determined relative to the location
       of the first event.  This requires all the files
       to have defined values of EVLA and EVLO.
    
   :OFFSET CASCADE:	SAC will consider each of the previous methods of
       determining the offsets in the order listed above,
       and look to see if the necessary data is present;
       it will use the first method for which the
       requesite information is available.
    
   :EC:  Elevation correction:
    
   :anginc:  Angle of incidence in degrees from the z axis (the more
       distant the signal source, the smaller anginc).
    
   :survel:  Surface medium velocity in kilometers per second.
    
   :CENTER:  Center station for which the beam is to be computed:
    
   :x:  Easterly  offset from the reference station, in meters.
    
   :y:  Northerly offset from the reference station, in meters.
    
   :z:  Upward    offset from the reference station, in meters.
    
   :Note:  CENTER positions the beam with respect to the offsets
       already determined according to the OFFSET option.  CENTER
       is not intended to offset a beam great distances; it is
       offered as a way to offset a beam to the center of an
       emplacement.
    
   :WRITE:  Write beam to disk.
    
   :fname:  File or path name. May be an absolute or relative pathname,
       or simple name of a file to appear in the dir in which SAC was
       started.
    
DEFAULT VALUES
--------------

  ``BEAM  B 90  V 9.0 EC 33  6.0 C  0. 0. 0. W beam``


DESCRIPTION
-----------
   BEAM_ does not overwrite existing input data in SAC memory, so it can be
   repeatedly issued while varying bearing and velocity.  The beam result is
   written to disk and may be targetted to a different file each time.  These
   design features anticipates users' need to compare multiple runs of this
   command to find the bearing and velocity that produced the maximal beam.

HEADER DATA
-----------
 See HEADER DATA section of BBFK_ command.


ERROR MESSAGES
--------------
 CENTER parameter missing offset z, when the presence of the
 EC parameter requires it.


LIMITATIONS
-----------
 The maximum number of stations allowed (see BBFK).

SEE COMMANDS
------------
  MAP:  for plotting stations in an array, according to x and y offsets stored
  in SAC header variables USER7 & USER8.  July 22, 1991 (Version 10.5c)
