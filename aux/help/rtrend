SUMMARY
-------
Removes the linear trend.

SYNTAX
------
::

  [RTR]END  [QUIET [ON | OFF]] [VERBOSE [ON | OFF]]

INPUT
-----
   :QUIET: If ON, supresses screen output
    
   :VERBOSE: If on, there is output to the screen about slope removed, et.
       
   :DEFAULT VALUES:  RTR QUIET

DESCRIPTION
-----------
   A least-squares curve-fit to a straight line is calculated.  This straight
   line (trend and intercept) is then "subtracted" from the data.  The data does
   not have to be evenly spaced.

   OUTPUT: The best-fitting straight line parameters for the last file in
   the data file list are written to blackboard variables begining with RTR.

   - RTR_SLP is the slope of the line.
   - RTR_SDSLP is the standard deviation in the slope.
   - RTR_YINT is the y intercept of the line.
   - RTR_SDYINT is the standard deviation in the y intercept.
   - RTR_SDDTA is the standard deviation in the data.
   - RTR_CORRCF is the data correlation coeficient.
