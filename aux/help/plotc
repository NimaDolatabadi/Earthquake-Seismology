DESCRIPTION
-----------
   This command lets you annotate SAC plots and create figures for
   meetings and reports.  A device with cursor capability is required.  You
   "build" a figure by placing objects and text on the terminal screen.  The
   cursor position determines where an object will be drawn and the character
   typed determines what object is to be drawn.  Objects include circles,
   rectangles, n-sided polygons, lines, arrows, and arcs.  Several ways of
   placing text are included.

   This command creates two different type of output files, simple files
   and macro files.  Both are alphanumeric files that can be changed using an
   editor.  They contain the history of the cursor responses and locations from
   a single execution of the PLOTC_ command.  A macro file, once created, can be
   used in more than one plot or figure.  It can be scaled in size and can also
   be rotated.  A simple PLOTC_ filename is the name you request with a ".PCF"
   appended to it.  A macro file has a ".PCM" appended to its' name.  This
   provides a check for SAC when you request a particular file and also lets you
   distinguish these files in your directories.

   When you create a new file or macro, SAC draws a rectangle on the
   screen showing you the allowable area for the figure.  It then turns the
   cursor on in the middle of this area.  You move the cursor to the desired
   location and type a character representing the object you want drawn or the
   action you want to occur.

   There are two types of cursor options, action and parameter-setting.
   The action options do something (draw a polygon, place text, etc.) How they
   do that action is based in part upon the current values of the
   parameter-setting options (how many sides on the polygon, what size text to
   draw, etc.) This distinction is similiar to the idea of action and
   parameter-setting commands in SAC itself.  The tables on the following pages
   list the action and parameter-setting options.

   When you replay a file or macro, the figure is redrawn on the terminal
   screen and then the cursor is turned on.  You may then add to the file or
   macro as if you were creating it for the first time.  When you have created a
   figure that you want to send to a different graphics device, use the
   BEGINDEVICES_ command to temporarily turn off the terminal and turn on the
   other device.  Then simply replay the file.

   To annotate a SAC plot, execute the VSPACE_ command to set up the correct
   aspect ratio (see below), execute the BEGINFRAME_ command to turn off
   automatic framing, execute the desired SAC plot command, execute the PLOTC_
   command (in create or replay mode), and then execute the ENDFRAME_ command to
   resume automatic framing.

EXAMPLES
--------
  An example of the use of PLOTC_ to add annotation to a standard SAC plot
  is the figure in the BANDPASS_ command description of this manual.  The
  commands used to create that figure are given below with comments given in
  parentheses::

      u:  FG IMPULSE NPTS 1024      \ \ (generate filter response)
      u:  LOWPASS C2 NPOLES 7 CORNER 0.2 TRANBW 0.25 A 10
      u:  FFT
      u:  AXES ONLY LEFT BOTTOM     \ \ (set up desired plot options)
      u:  TICKS ONLY LEFT BOTTOM
      u:  BORDER OFF
      u:  FILEID OFF
      u:  QDP OFF
      u:  VSPACE 0.75              \ \ (see discussion below)
      u:  BEGINFRAME               \ \ (turn off automatic framing)
      u:  PLOTSP AM LINLIN         \ \ (plot filter response)
      u:  PLOTC CREATE FILE BANDPASS      \ \ (create annotation)
      u:  ENDFRAME                 \ \ (turn automatic framing back on)

  PLOTSP_ was used to produce the curve of the filter response and the two axes.
  PLOTC_ was used interactively to produce the annotation (i.e., the lines,
  arrows, and labels.) The viewspace command constrains the plot be the largest
  enclosed area of the graphics screen that has an \ \ (y:x) aspect ratio of
  3:4.  This is necessary so that when the output is later sent to the 
  SGF_ device which also has a 3:4 aspect ratio, everything will be 
  plotted correctly.  At this point you would have a file called 
  "BANDPASS.PCF" containing the annotations for this plot.  To write this 
  annotated plot to the SAC graphics file::

      u:  BEGINDEVICES SGF   \ \ (select the SGF device)
      u:  BEGINFRAME         \ \ (turn off automatic framing)
      u:  PLOTSP             \ \ (plot filter response again)
      u:  PLOTC REPLAY       \ \ (replay the annotation)
      u:  ENDFRAME           \ \ (turn automatic framing back on)

  A SAC graphics file will be created containing the annotated plot.
  Two examples (one somewhat frivolous) of the use of PLOTC_ to create
  figures and viewgraphs are given on the following pages.  The replay files are
  also shown.  (It is an exercise left to the reader to determine which of the
  examples is frivolous.)

    1. The circle and sector opcodes only produce correct output when you have
       set the viewspace to a square one (VSPACE 1.0).
       Otherwise, they produce an ellipse with the ratio of the minor to major
       axis equal to the aspect ratio of the viewspace.

    2. All all of the opcodes except text are scaled to fit in the graphics
       window.

  The text sizes aren't currently scaled.  This creates a problem when you
  create a figure and want to enclose some text in a rectangle or a circle.
  In this case the graphics window must be the same size as the output page
  in order to avoid misalignment.

  This can be achieved by using the WINDOW_ command to set the horizontal (x)
  size of the window to be 0.75 and the vertical (y) size to be 0.69.
  For example:  WINDOW_ 1 X 0.05 0.80 Y 0.05 0.74
  This command must be executed before the window is created (i.e. before the
  BEGINWINDOW_ or BEGINDEVICES_ command.)

    3. The text feature of this command works only in SunView graphics windows.

  TABLE: Action Options::

    char  meaning
    A     Draw an arrow from ORIGIN to CURSOR.
    B     Draw border tick marks around plot region.
    C     Draw a circle centered at ORIGIN through CURSOR.
    D     Delete last action option from replay file.
    G     Set ORIGIN and make it global.
    L     Draw a line from ORIGIN to CURSOR.
    M     Invoke a macro at CURSOR.
    Enter name of macro, scale factor, and rotation angle.
    Previous values are used if omitted.
    Defaults are OUT, 1., and 0.
    O     Set ORIGIN at CURSOR.
    N     Draw an n-sided polygon centered at ORIGIN
    with one vertex at CURSOR.
    Q     Quit PLOTC_.
    R     Draw a rectangle with opposing corners
    at ORIGIN and CURSOR.
    S     Draw a sector of a circle centered at ORIGIN through
    CURSOR  Move CURSOR to define the sector angle.
    Type an S to get the sector whose angle is less than
    180 degrees or C to get its' complement.
    T     Place a single line of text at cursor.
    Text is ended by a carriage-return.
    U     Place multiple lines of text at cursor.
    Text is ended by a blank line.

  Notes:

   - CURSOR is the current cursor location
   - ORIGIN is normally the last cursor location
   - The G option forces ORIGIN to remain fixed
   - The O option allows ORIGIN to move again
   - The Q option is not automatically copied to the file
     but may be added to it with a text editor.

  If SAC does not see a Q in the file during replay mode,
  it goes back into cursor mode after displaying the contents
  of the file.  This lets you append more options to the end
  of a file.  If SAC does see a Q in the file, it displays the
  contents and ends PLOTC_.

   - A line beginning with an asterisk is treated as a comment line.
