DESCRIPTION
-----------
  This command searches for the requested value in each data file and marks the
  time of the first occurance of that value.  If a measurement time window has
  been defined (see MTW), only that portion of each data file is searched.
  Otherwise the entire file is searched.  The results are written into the
  header in the requested time marker.

EXAMPLES
--------
  To search for the first data point whose value is at least 3.4 and to store
  the result in the header as T7::

      u:  MARKVALUE GE 3.4 TO T7

  To later perform that same search in the measurement time window 10 seconds
  long beginning at T4::

      u:  MTW T4 0 10
      u:  MARKVALUE
