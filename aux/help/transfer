DESCRIPTION
-----------
   The default input and output "instrument" in TRANSFER is
   displacement, which in SAC is designated as NONE.  Hence, if a
   FROM type or a TO type is not specified, SAC assumes it to be
   NONE. If the output instrument is NONE, IDEP in the SAC header
   is set to DISPLACEMENT (NM).  For the seismometers listed in the
   table below, the output units for TO NONE  will be in nm, SAC's
   choice for displacement.  If TRANSFER has TO VEL or TO ACC, the
   header variable IDEP is changed accordingly for all waveforms
   in memory.

   If the TO type is specified as anything other than NONE, VEL, or
   ACC, the waveforms in memory are transformed to that instrument
   type.  If the FROM instrument type is NONE, then no instrument
   is  removed, and the original trace is presumed to be a
   displacement.   This is useful for adding instrument responses
   to synthetic seismograms.

   Care must be taken when calling TRANSFER a second time within
   a single SAC session, because in the second call TRANSFER will
   use the same arguments for FROM, TO, FREQ, etc. as in the first
   call unless an alternative argument is explicitly provided.

   Many of the instruments have options that further specify the
   response. The most common of these options is the instrument
   subtype.  A few instruments require that certain numerical
   parameters be specified and do not use the subtype option.
   For a list of instruments and a list of the instruments that
   use subtypes or other parameters, see the table below.

   When TRANSFER was introduced more than 20 years ago, the
   data acquisition systems were much simpler.  The seismometers in
   the list at the end of this message include the most popular
   ones used previously. Now the majority of data analysis is done
   on data sets commonly exchanged as SEED volumes, which can be
   downloaded from the IRIS Data Management Center over the
   Internet.  These data can be read from SEED volumes using the
   program RDSEED, which is available for all computer operating
   systems that can run SAC.  The EVALRESP program calculates the
   complete system response from response (RESP) files produced by
   RDSEED.  EVALRESP routines have been embedded within TRANSFER as
   an "instrument" type, allowing a user to perform (de)convolution
   using the complete system response represented in RESP files.
   For the source code for programs RDSEED and EVALRESP, go to URL
   <http://www.iris.edu/dms/nodes/dmc/software/downloads/>.  for the SEED
   manual, go to < http://www.fdsn.org/seed_manual/SEEDManual_V2.4.pdf>.

   Most of the implementation is done using double-precision
   (64-bit) arithmetic even though the SAC data is single-precision.
   
   The SAC sign convention for Laplace/Fourier transforms is the same as
   that used in RDSEED and EVALRESP: phase for a causal response decreases 
   with increasing frequency.  For displacements, the SAC convention is nm,
   while RDSEED RESP files use meters.  The EVALRESP option in TRANSFER
   corrects the output to the SAC convention.  For other options (FAP, PZ)
   it may be ncessary to change the units. (See examples below.)

   FREQLIMITS f1 f2 f3 f4  :  All seismometers have zero response
   at zero frequency.  When deconvolving and not convolving
   with another response (e.g. "TO NONE"), it is therefore
   necessary to modify the response at very low frequencies.
   At high frequencies, the signal-to-noise ratio is often low,
   so it may be desirable to dampen the response.  FREQLIMITS
   serves this purpose within SAC. FREQLIMITS has both a
   low-pass and a high-pass taper. It is necessary that f1 < f2
   < f3 < f4.  The taper is unity between f2 and f3 and zero
   below f1 and above f4.  Frequencies f1 and f2 specify the
   high-pass filter at low frequencies, while frequencies f3
   and f4 specify the low-pass filter at high frequencies. The
   filters applied between f1 and f2 and between f3 and f4 are
   quarter cycles of a cosine wave.
   
   If you want to do a low-pass filter but have no filtering at low
   frequencies, one way is to set f1=-2 and f2=-1.  If you want to  do
   a high-pass filter but have no filtering at the high frequencies, for
   a Nyquist frequency of 0.5, set f3=10. and f4=20.
   
   Note that because this filter has zero phase, it is not causal.
   As a result, if npts is not a power of 2, the output amplitude 
   will not be zero outside the interval (f1,f4).  If it is important
   to have the number of points an exact power of 2, the help file for
   CUT_ explains how to modify your file within SAC.

   Note that the default has no FREQLIMITS.  It is strongly advised
   that one includes FREQLIMITS if one is doing a deconvolution.

   PREWHITENING:  Prewhitening can be used to flatten the spectrum
   of the input time series before transforming in the
   frequency domain. This should reduce the dynamic range of
   the spectral values, and improve the accuracy of the
   overall operation at high frequencies for seismic data. The
   default for prewhitening is off.  See command WHITEN_ for
   further information.

   PREWHITENING ON   : Turns on prewhitening in the time domain
   before spectral operations, and compensating dewhitening in
   the time domain after spectral operations.

   PREWHITENING OFF  :  Turns off prewhitening.

   PREWHITENING n  :  Turns on prewhitening and change the
   prewhitening order to n. If the user turns it on without
   specifying the order, it will default to n=6, unless the
   order has been changed in the WHITEN_ command.


EVALRESP OPTION
---------------
  This option enables the application of transfer functions
  extracted from SEED data volumes using the EVALRESP code
  (Version 3.3.3). To use this option, one needs RESP files,
  commonly these are produced from SEED volumes by the RDSEED
  program.  The RESP files must be in the current directory or
  must be specified by full path and name.
  
  There is no formal documentation for the RESP files themselves, but since they
  refer directly to the SEED format you can read the SEED manual to learn more
  about the values.
  
  To identify the correct RESP file and to extract the proper
  transfer function from that file, EVALRESP uses information from
  the SAC headers.  The fields are station (KSTNM), channel
  (KCMPNM), date and time (KZDATE & KZTIME), network (KNETWK), and
  location ID. Location ID is referred to as LOCID; it commonly
  distinguishes between multiple instruments with the same
  network, station and channel names, operating at the same
  time.  Data received from IRIS in SAC format (or converted to
  SAC with RDSEED) will have KHOLE set to a valid LOCID if one is
  necessary.  If the user is informed of real LOCIDs in the
  EVALRESP file, the user can set KHOLE with CH (HELP CH for
  details).  SAC will use KHOLE as LOCID if it is a two character
  alpha-numeric string (padded with spaces or not).

  It is possible to override the header values by specifying
  additional options to EVALRESP. The possible options are::

    STATION, CHANNEL, NETWORK, DATE, TIME, LOCID, FNAME

  and each option must be followed by an appropriate value. If
  DATE is not set in the header and is not specified as an option,
  then the current date is used in the search.  If TIME is not
  set in the   seismogram header and is not specified as an
  option, then the current system time is used in the search.  If
  network is not specified, then the search for a transfer
  function defaults to use any network.  If LOCID is not set at
  the command line or in KHOLE, then the search for the transfer
  function defaults to use any LOCID.  To force TRANSFER to use a
  specific SEED response file use the FNAME option followed by
  the filename.

  If the FNAME option is not specified EVALRESP will attempt to
  identify the correct file in the current working directory using
  the  general form::

    RESP.<NET>.<STA>.<LOCID>.<CHAN>

  for example: "RESP.IU.ANMO..BHZ"

  The embedded version of EVALRESP is configured to always produce
  a displacement response in SI units (i.e. displacement in
  meters), which SAC scales by a factor of 1.0e9 to conform to the
  SAC convention of units of displacement (nanometers).

EVALRESP EXAMPLES
-----------------

  To remove the instrument response from the seismogram in memory
  (assuming a response file exists)::

    SAC> r 2006.253.14.30.24.0000.TA.N11A..LHZ.Q.SAC
    SAC> RTR
    SAC> TAPER
    SAC> TRANS FROM EVALRESP TO NONE freq 0.004 0.007 0.2 0.4

  To remove the instrument response from the same waveform but
  using a response contained in file
  /tmp/Responses/RESP.TA.N11A..LHZ::

    SAC> SETBB RESP "/tmp/Responses/RESP.TA.N11A..LHZ"
    SAC> r 2006.253.14.30.24.0000.TA.N11A..LHZ.Q.SAC
    SAC> RTR
    SAC> TAPER
    SAC> TRANSFER FROM EVALRESP FNAME %resp TO NONE FREQLIM 0.004 0.007 0.2 0.4

  To remove the instrument response from
  16.42.05.5120.TS.PAS.BHZ.SAC and apply the response from station
  COL, channel BHZ for the same time period::

    SAC> R 16.42.05.5120.TS.PAS.BHZ.SAC
    SAC> RTR
    SAC> TAPER
    SAC> TRANS FROM EVALRESP TO EVALRESP STATION COL

  To display the instrument response in units of displacement for
  station COL, channel BHZ, network IU, for the date 1992/02 and
  time 16:42:05::

    SAC> FG IMPULSE NPTS 16384 DELTA .05 BEGIN 0.
    SAC> TRANS TO EVALRESP STATION COL CHANNEL BHZ NETWORK IU DATE 1992/2 TIME 16:42:05
    SAC> FFT
    SAC> PSP AM
 
  COMMENTS: rtr removes any trend and offset.  Because the FFT_
  called by TRANSFER pads with zeroes to a power of 2 number of
  points, TAPER eliminates any large jumps at the ends of the time
  series.  FREQLIMITS is necessary for deconvolutions TO NONE because
  the instrument has zero response at zero frequency.

POLEZERO OPTION
---------------
  POLEZERO is an instrument type that can be used to put in or
  take out the (analog) seismometer response.  A good reference is
  Appendix C in the SEED manual.  
  
  A polezero file as written may be for displacement, velocity, or acceleration,
  and the units of the output should be known in advance.  If the polezero
  file was written by program RDSEED 5.0 or later, this information is included
  in the file (see example below).
  
  The transfer function, H(s), is the Laplace transform of the linear system 
  impulse response of the seismometer.  The Laplace variable s = 2*pi*i*f, 
  where f is the frequency in Hz.

  The response H(w) is the ratio of the product of the difference
  between s and each of the np poles and nz zeros::

            (s-z )*(s-z )*...*(s-z  )
                1      2          nz
     H(s) = -------------------------
            (s-p )*(s-p )*...*(s-p  )
                1      2          np

  The options in the file (poles, zeros, constant, and comment
  lines) are keyword driven and numbers are in free format.
  CONSTANT is a scaling factor.  (See the SEED manual for how it
  is defined for polezero files produced by RDSEED.) The default for
  CONSTANT is 1.0 if one omits this line.  one specifies the
  number of poles by putting a line in the file with the keyword
  "POLES" followed by an integer number (np in the above
  example).  The next np lines in the file, each containing two 
  floating-point numbers, are the poles for this instrument.  One
  specifies the zeros with a line starting with "ZEROS" followed by an
  integer specifying the number of zeros (nz).  Because a typical
  polezero file has one or more zeros that are (0.0,0.0),  SAC
  does not require one to write out a line for a zero equal to
  (0.0,0.0). One may specify up to 30 poles and 30 zeros.
  
  The original SAC polezero files only contained poles, zeroes, and a 
  constant.  Recently, it has been determined that supplying formatted 
  comments as a header in the polezero file helps greatly for users to 
  organize and understand the origins of the coefficients presented.  
  For this reason, SAC now supports the 'annotated' polezero file, 
  which can be readily produced by IRIS DMC's RDSEED program (v5.2, 
  October 2011) as well as IRIS DMC's SAC PZ web service 
  <http://www.iris.edu/ws/sacpz>.  (RDSEED v5.0 had annotation lines
  with slightly different formats for some entries.  SAC v 101.5 can
  handle files written by either v5.0 or 5.2 of RDSEED.  Polezero files
  produced by a request to sacpz are in the RDSEED 5.2 format.) If a 
  waveform in memory has header values KSTNM, KCMPNM, KZDATE, and KZTIME 
  that match entries for a polezero file in the call to TRANSFER, the 
  command will work for that waveform.  Depending on the request format, 
  a fpolezero file returned by sacpz may include multile polezero files
  covering more than one time epoch as well as more than one station and/or
  channel.  A call to transfer using such a file will work satisfactorily
  for all waveforms in memory with anotation values that match the header
  values.
  
  Here is a polezero file written by program RDSEED (v5.2).  Earlier 
  versions of RDSEED have a slightly different format for the
  comments (v5.0) or may have no comments (earlier versions)::

  For this transfer function, there are six poles, for which the
  complex  values are listed on the five lines following the line
  POLES 6.  There are six zeros, but because only three are listed,
  the three not listed have the value of (0.0,0.0).
  
  Note: On some platforms, RDSEED v5.1 produces incorrect END times -- often
  earlier than the START time, so TRANSFER will not work.  Manually changing
  END to a time later than CREATED will allow TRANSFER to process that
  waveform.

  To use this option, one specifies the type to be POLEZERO and
  the [S]ubtype is the name of the file.  This may be a file in
  the current directory or in some other directory if one
  specifies the absolute or relative pathname.

PZ EXAMPLES
-----------

  The PZ file SAC_PZs_XC_OR075_LHZ is the correct one to remove the
  instrument response from waveform OR075_LHZ.SAC. 
  (Names are shortened from those rturned by RDSEED.)::

    SAC> SETBB pzfile "SAC_PZs_XC_OR075_LHZ"
    SAC> READ OR075_LHZ.SAC
    SAC> RTR
    SAC> TAPER
    SAC> TRANS FROM POLEZERO S %pzfile TO NONE FREQ 0.008 0.016 0.2 0.4
    SAC> MUL 1.0e9
    SAC> w OR075.z

  COMMENTS: If the polezero file was produced by the RDSEED program
  from a SEED volume, the poles and zeros will be in units of
  displacement with length units the same as contained in the SEED
  volume, which is almost always meters.  The polezero file for a
  given sensor represents only one piece of the response
  information available in a SEED volume.  The polezero file in
  this example is such a file.  It includes only the first stage of
  the instrument response: the seismometer.  Not included are later stages 
  in the response that include FIR and IIR  filters. EVALRESP calculates 
  responses using all stages, but in most applications the POLEZERO stage 
  suffices.  Unlike EVALRESP, SAC does not know where the  polezero file 
  comes from, so in this case, it is necessary to multiply the waveform 
  by 1.0e9 to convert from meters to nanometers.   The command w OR075.z 
  produces a waveform that is instrument corrected to displacement in nm.
  
  Fot the above example, suppose one had not used SAC_PZs_XC_OR075_LHZ
  but instead has used an inappropriate PZ file: SAC_PZs_wrong.  The following
  procedure shows how one can use one call to TRANSFER to take out the incorrect
  response and put in the correct response::
  
      SAC> READ OR075.z
      SAC> write OR075.zbad
      SAC> SETBB pzo "SAC_PZs_wrong"
      SAC> SETBB pzn "SAC_PZs_XC_OR075_LHZ"
      SAC> TRANS FROM POLEZERO S %pzn TO POLEZERO S %pzo FREQ 0.008 0.015 0.2 0.4
      SAC> write OR075.z

  The first write statement makes a copy of the original file.
  
  As a final example we consider the case for which one has several stations and
  BH* channels for waveforms from an event in the calling directory written by
  RDSEED v5.2.  Assume one has either made a call to sacpz or concatinated all the
  BH* PZ files for this event into a single file named event.pz.  The following 
  sequence will read all the BH* waveforms into memory and overwrite those files
  in memory with instrument-corrected waveforms::
  
       SAC> r *BH*SAC
       SAC> rtr;taper
       SAC> TRANS FROM POLEZERO S event.pz freq 0.05 0.1 10.0 15.0


FAPfile OPTION
---------------

  Reintroduced into Sac in version 101.4, is the FAPfile option.
  A FAPFILE is an ascii file in which each line has three entries:
  a frequency (in HZ), an amplitude, and a phase (in degrees that will
  decrease with increasing frequency).  This FROM option will deconvolve
  the waveform over the frequency range from the frequency in the first
  line to the frequency in the last line.  The frequencies need not be
  equally spaced.  When applying the correction, for frequencies less that
  the frequency in the first line, the amplitude and phase of that first
  line are used.  Similarly, for frequencies greater than that in the last
  line, the amplitude and phase for the frequency in the last line are used.
  
  As of version 3.3.2 in EVALRESP, a FAPfile output can be generated.  An
  advantage of using a FAPFILE generated by EVALRESP rather than a POLEZERO
  file generated from the same RESP file is that one can include additional
  stages of the instrument response and/or control more explicitly the
  frequency range over which the correction is applied.  Historically, a
  FAPFILE was used because one did not have a polezero file for the 
  instrument or the full response included analog stages.
  
  The format of a FAP file is consistent with that produced by the standalone
  program EVALRESP (v3.3.3), but is different from the format used by SAC2000.
  
FAP EXAMPLES
------------

  Suppose one has a fapfile fap.n11a.lhz_0.006-0.2, where the name is a short-hand 
  for the fact that the frequency range is from0.006 HZto 0.2 HZ, and one wants to 
  remove the instrument response from waveform
  2006.253.14.30.24.0000.TA.N11A..LHZ.Q.SA. ::

    SAC> READ 2006.253.14.30.24.0000.TA.N11A..LHZ.Q.SAC
    SAC> RTR
    SAC> TAPER
    SAC> TRANSFER FROM FAP S fap.n11a.lhz_0.006-0.2 FREQ 0.004 0.006 0.1 0.2
    SAC> MUL 1.0e9

  COMMENTS: As with the EVALRESP and POLEZERO options, one should accompany
  the instrument correction with a FREQLIMITS option to handle the highest 
  and lowest frequencies.  (The Nyquist for this LHZ file is 0.5 Hz.)

EXAMPLES
--------

  To remove the instrument response from the RSTN station NYKM.Z
  and apply the instrument response for DSS without prewhitening
  (which is the default)::

      SAC> READ NYKM.Z
      SAC> TRANS FROM RSTN SUBTYPE NYKM.Z TO DSS PREW OFF

  To remove the LLL broadband instrument response and apply the SRO
  instrument response with frequency tapering and prewhitening::

      SAC> READ ABC.Z
      SAC> TRANS FROM LLL TO SRO FREQ .02 .05 1. 2. PREW 2

  The passband of the resulting trace will be flat from .05 Hz to 1
  Hz and will be zero below .02 Hz and above 2 Hz.  Prewhitening of
  order 2 is applied in the time domain before deconvolution and
  the effect is removed in the time domain after convolution.

  To transfer from the electromagnetic instrument response to
  displacement::

      SAC>  READ XYZ.Z
      SAC>  TRANSFER FROM ELMAG FREEP 15. MAG 750. TO NONE

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
----------------
  Roger Hanscom did the original conversion of Keith
  Nakanishi's TRANSFER program. George Randall added the prewhitening
  option and was a major contributor to the testing and documentation of
  this command.  Doug Dodge included the EVALRESP option.

LATEST REVISION
---------------
   August 2011 (Version 101.5) In previous versions, if the header vaiable
   SCALE was defined, it might be used in scaling the output and would be 
   changed.  In this version, SCALE is ignored.
