QUANTIZE
++++++++

SUMMARY
-------
Converts continuous data into its quantized equivalent.

SYNTAX
------

  ``QUANTIZE [GAINS n ...],[LEVEL v],[MANTISSA n]``

INPUT
-----
   :GAINS n ...:  Set list of allowed gains.  They must be monotonically
       decreasing.  The maximum number of allowed gains is 8.
    
   :LEVEL v:  Set the quantization level of the lowest gain.  This is the
       value of the least significant bit in volts.
    
   :MANTISSA n:  Set the number of bits in the mantissa.
    
DEFAULT VALUES
--------------

  ``QUANTIZE GAINS 128 32 8 1 LEVEL 0.00001 MANTISSA 14``

DESCRIPTION
-----------
   This command exercises a quantization algorithm equivalent to the
   "rounding" quantization described in Oppenheim and Schafer (1975, Fig. 9.1).
   The number of bits used in this algorithm are partitioned into the bits used
   to represent the characteristic (exponent), the sign bit, and the mantissa
   bits.  The user can specify the number of bits used for the mantissa.
   The quantization level (value of least significant bit or LSB) can also
   be specified by the user.  The default quantization level is 10 microvolts.
   The error of the signal represented by this quantized function is numerically
   equal to one-half of this quantization level.  In the spectral domain, this
   error or quantization noise is::

     ERROR = 1/12 * (DELTA * LEVEL^2)

   where DELTA is the sampling interval.  This quantization noise is measured
   in units of counts*counts/Hz, as a power spectral density.  The 
   rms-squared quantization noise is::
      
       (1/6)*LEVEL^2.  
       
   However, this is an accurate approximation to the noise due to 
   quantization only if the rms level of the signal is much larger than the 
   rms quantization noise.  In other words, if the signal is not resolved 
   by several hundred counts, then there is a correlation between the 
   quantization noise and the signal being quantized.  The fraction of 
   correlation is approximately equal to the ratio of the LEVEL to the rms of
   the signal being quantized (see Fig. 11.13, Oppenheim and Schaffer, 1975).
   The gains can be specified by the user to simulate the gain steps in an
   automatic gain-ranging system.  The default gains are those of the Regional
   Seismic Test Network (RSTN.) Oppenheim, Alan V., and Ronald W. Schafer;
   Digital Signal Processing; Prentice-Hall; 1975; 585pp.
