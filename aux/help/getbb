GETBB
+++++

SUMMARY
-------
Gets (prints) values of blackboard variables.

SYNTAX
------

  ``GETBB {options}  ALL|variable {variable ...}``
   where options is one or more of the following:


  ``TO TERMINAL|filename``

  ``NAMES ON|OFF``

  ``NEWLINE ON|OFF``


INPUT
-----
   :TO TERMINAL:  Print the values to the terminal.
    
   :TO filename:  Append the values to a file called filename.
    
   :NAMES [ON]:  Include the name of the blackboard variable followed by
       an equals sign and then its value.
    
   :NAMES OFF:  Only print the value of the blackboard variable.
    
   :NEWLINE [ON]:  Put a newline (carriage-return) after each blackboard
       value printed.
    
   :NEWLINE OFF:  Do not a newline after each value.
    
   :ALL:  Print the values of all currently defined blackboard variables.
    
    
   :variable:  Print the values of the specific blackboard variables
       listed.

DESCRIPTION
-----------
   The blackboard is a place to temporarily store information.  This command lets
   you print the values of selected blackboard variables.  Variables can be
   defined using the SETBB_ command.  You can also use the EVALUATE_ command to
   perform basic arithmetic operations on blackboard variables and store the
   results in new blackboard variables.  Blackboard variables can also be
   substituted directly into SAC commands.  See the section on Macros in the
   Users Manual.
   The options to this command let you control where the values are printed
   and in what format to print them.  You can print them to the terminal or
   append them to the end of a text file.  You can include the variable name and
   an equals sign before the value or you can just have the value printed.  You
   can have a newline placed after each value printed in a list or you can have
   them placed on a single line.  You can use these options to make measurements
   on a set of data files, extract these measurements into a text file, and then
   read this file back into SAC using the READALPHA command to plot the results
   or to perform more analysis.  This is illustrated in the examples section.

EXAMPLES
--------
   Assume you have already set several blackboard variables::

      u:  SETBB C1 2.45 C2 4.94

   To later print their values you would use this command::

      u:  GETBB C1 C2
      s:  C1 = 2.45
      s:  C2 = 4.94

   To print just their values on a single line::

      u:  GETBB NAMES OFF NEWLINE OFF C1 C2
      s:  2.45 4.94

   Assume you have a macro called GETXY that performs some type of analysis on a
   single data file and stores the results into two blackboard variables called
   X and Y.  You want to perform this analysis on all of the vertical components
   in the current directory, save each set of X and Y values, and plot them.  In
   the following macro the first (and only) argument is the name of the text
   file to be used to store the results::

     DO FILE WILD *Z
     READ FILE
     MACRO GETXY
     GETBB TO 1 NAMES OFF NEWLINE OFF X Y
     ENDDO

     GETBB_ TO TERMINAL
     READALPHA CONTENT P 1
     PLOT

   The text file would contain pairs of x-y data points, one per line, for each
   of the vertical data files.  The final GETBB_ command redirecting the output
   back to the terminal is needed in order to close the text file and dump the
   buffer.
