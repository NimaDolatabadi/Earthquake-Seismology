SUMMARY
-------
Controls the linestyle selection in plots.

SYNTAX
------

  ``LINE {ON|OFF|SOLID|DOTTED|n} {FILL ON|OFF|{POS_COLOR|NEG_COLOR}}``

  ``{INCREMENT {ON|OFF}}, {LIST STANDARD|nlist}``

INPUT
-----
   :{ON}:  Turn line drawing on.  Don't change linestyle.

   :OFF:  Turn line drawing off.

   :SOLID:  Change to solid linestyle and turn line drawing on.

   :DOTTED:  Change to dotted linestyle and turn line drawing on.

   :n:  Change to linestyle n and turn line drawing on.  A linestyle of 0
       is the same as turning turning line drawing off.

   :FILL ON/OF:   Turn filling on/off.
   
   :FILL POS_COLOR/NEG_COLOR:   Fill color for positive/negative section of
       the seismogram trace.
   
   :FILL LIST STANDARD:  Use Standard color list for Color Filling.
    
   :fILL LIST POS_COLOR/NEG_COLOR:  Turn on color filling incrementing m
       ultiple colors in a list are available to set colors.  Colors are 
       specified in either Color Name or Number

   :INCREMENT {ON}:  Increment linestyle from linestyle list after each
       data file is plotted.

   :INCREMENT OFF:  Do not increment data linestyle.

   :LIST nlist:  Change the content of the linestyle list.  Enter list of
       linestyle numbers.

   :LIST STANDARD:  Change to the standard linestyle list.

DEFAULT VALUES
--------------

  ``LINE SOLID INCREMENT OFF LIST STANDARD``

DESCRIPTION
-----------
  This command controls the linestyle used when plotting data.  The
  skeleton (axes, titles, etc.) are always plotted using solid lines.  Grid
  linestyle is controlled by the GRID_ command.

  There are other commands that control other aspects of the data display.
  The SYMBOL_ command can be used to display a set of scalable, centered symbols
  at each data point.  The COLOR_ command controls color selection for color
  graphics devices.  All of these attributes are independent of each other.  You
  may select a blue dotted line with a symbol at each data point if you desire
  A linestyle of 0 is the same as turning turning line drawing off.  This
  is useful in the LIST option and the SYMBOL_ command to display some data with
  lines and some with symbols on the same plot.  See the example below.

EXAMPLES
--------
  To select an incrementing linestyle starting with linestyle 1::

      SAC>  LINE 1 INCREMENT

  To change the linestyle list to contain linestyles 3, 5, and 1::

      SAC>  LINE LIST 3 5 1

  To plot three files on the same plot using PLOT2_ with the first file plotted
  using a solid line and no symbol, the second with no line and a triangle
  symbol, and the third with no line and a cross symbol::

      SAC>  READ FILE1 FILE2 FILE3
      SAC>  LINE LIST 1 0 0 INCREMENT
      SAC>  SYMBOL LIST 0 3 7 INCREMENT
      SAC>  PLOT2
      
  To fill in the positive ecursions on a seismogram with red and the negtive 
  excursions with blue.  If one left out the 0, the colored regions would be
  outlined with a black line::
  
      SAC> fg seismo
      SAC> line 0 fill red/blue
      SAC> p1
