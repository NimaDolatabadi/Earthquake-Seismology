PICKPHASE
+++++++++

SUMMARY
-------
Tell sac to read phase pick information (and possibly the author list) from
a user-defined preferences file, or interactively enter phase pick information
on the PICKPHASE_ command line.

SYNTAX
------

  ``PICKPHASE header phase author {header phase author ... }``

  ``PICKPHASE FILE {filename}``

  ``PICKPHASE AUTHOR {filename}``

INPUT
-----
   :header: name of a header variable: t0 - t9.
   :phase:  name of phase of pick desired for the given header variable.
   :author: name of the author desired for the given header or hyphen, "-",
       to tell sac to use the author list.
    
   :FILE:	if the FILE option is used, sac will read the phase pick info.
       from the preferences file.  If a filename is given on the
       command line, sac will read the specified file, else it will
       read the most recently entered file name from a previous
       call to PICKPHASE_.  If no filename was ever entered, sac
       will look for SACAUX/csspickprefs.
    
   :PHASE:	this option behaves essencially like the FILE option with
       the added benefit of having sac read the author list as well.

DESCRIPTION
-----------
  PICKPHASE_ is provided as a means to override the preferences file on the
  command line.  It can be used to provide specific header/phase/author
  information at the command line, or to redirect SAC from one preferences file
  to another.  For more on the preferences files, see PICKPREFS_ and READCSS_.

  Note:  If the user alters the preference settings while data is in the data
  buffers, the picks in the SAC data buffer (the buffer visible to the user
  through LISTHDR_ and CHNHDR_ etc.) may be modified.
  Eg. if the allowed phases include pP and PKiKP when some SAC files are read
  with the READ_ command which have some pP picks or some PKiKP picks these 
  picks would be present in the Tn markers.  
  If PICKPHASE_ is later used to remove pP and PKiKP from the allowed phases 
  before the next READCSS_ MORE call, then pP and PKiKP arrivals will not 
  be read from the CSS files, and the pP and PKiKP picks in the existing 
  data will be removed from the Tn markers.  For an explanation, 
  type HELP_ PICKPREFS_.
