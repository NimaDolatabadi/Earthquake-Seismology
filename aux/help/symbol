SYMBOL
++++++

SUMMARY
-------
Controls the symbol plotting attributes.

SYNTAX
------

  ``SYMBOL {ON|OFF|n} {SIZE v},{SPACING v},``

  ``{INCREMENT {ON|OFF}},{LIST STANDARD|nlist}``

INPUT
-----
   :ON:  Turn symbol plotting on.  Don't change symbol number.
    
   :OFF:  Turn symbol plotting off.
    
   :n:  Turn symbol plotting on.  Change symbol number to n.  There are 16
       different symbols.  A symbol number of 0 is the same as turning
       symbol plotting off.
    
   :SIZE v:  Set symbol size to v.  A value of 0.01 sets the size to 1
       percent of the full plot size.
    
   :SPACING v:  Set symbol spacing to v.  This is the minimum spacing
       between drawn symbols.  Use 0 if you want a symbol at every data
       point.  Use 0.2 to 0.4 for annotating lines.
    
   :INCREMENT {ON}:  Increment symbol number after each data file.  The
       symbol number is the next one in the symbol list.
    
   :INCREMENT OFF:  Do not increment symbol number.
    
   :LIST nlist:  Change the content of the symbol list.  Enter list of
       symbol numbers.  Sets symbol number to first entry in list and turns
       symbol plotting on.
    
   :LIST STANDARD:  Change to the standard symbol list.  Sets symbol
       number to first entry in list and turns symbol plotting on.
    
DEFAULT VALUES
--------------

  ``SYMBOL OFF SIZE 0.01 SPACING 0. INCREMENT OFF LIST STANDARD``

DESCRIPTION
-----------
  The figure that follows shows each of the sixteen symbols.  Symbol 1
  cannot be scaled in size.  It is a replacement for the point symbol which does
  not show up well on many devices (e.g. Versatec, pen plotter).  This figure
  also shows examples of different symbol size and spacing values.  These symbol
  attributes are independent of the line drawing attributes defined by the LINE_
  command.  With line drawing on, they can be used to annotate different lines 
  on the same plot.  By turning the line drawing off, they can be used to create
  scatter plots.

  If you are plotting several data files on the same plot, you may want
  each to be plotted with a different symbol.  This is done using the INCREMENT
  option.  When this option is on, the symbol is incremented from a list of
  symbols each time a data file is plotted.  The default symbol list contains
  symbols 2 through 16.  You may change the order or content of this list using
  the LIST option.  This is useful if you are doing a series of overlay plots
  (see PLOT2) and want the same symbols used in the same order on each plot.
  A symbol number of 0 is the same as turning symbol plotting off.  This
  is useful in the LIST option and the LINE_ command to display some data with
  lines and some with symbols on the same plot.  See the example below.

EXAMPLES
--------
  To create a scatter plot, turn the line drawing off, choose an appropriate
  symbol, and plot::

      u:  LINE OFF
      u:  SYMBOL 5
      u:  PLOT

  To annotate four solid lines on a PLOT2_ plot using symbols 7, 4, 6, and 8,
  and a spacing of 0.3::

      u:  LINE SOLID
      u:  SYM SPACING .3 INCREMENT LIST 7 4 6 8
      u:  R FILE1 FILE2 FILE3 FILE4
      u:  PLOT2

  To plot three files on the same plot using PLOT2_ with the first file plotted
  using a solid line and no symbol, the second with no line and a triangle
  symbol, and the third with no line and a cross symbol::

      u:  READ FILE1 FILE2 FILE3
      u:  LINE LIST 1 0 0 INCREMENT
      u:  SYMBOL LIST 0 3 7 INCREMENT
      u:  PLOT2
