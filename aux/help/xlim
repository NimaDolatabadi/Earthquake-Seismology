XLIM
++++

SUMMARY
-------
Determines the plot limits for the x axis.

SYNTAX
------

  ``XLIM {ON|OFF|pdw|SIGNAL}``

INPUT
-----
   :{ON}:  Turn x limits on but don't change limits.
    
   :OFF:  Turn x limits off.
    
   :pdw:  Turn x limits on and set limits to a new "partial data window."
       A pdw consists of a starting and a stopping value of the
       independent variable, usually time, which defines the desired
       window of data that you wish to plot.  See the CUT_ command for a
       complete explanation of how to define and use a pdw.  Some examples
       are given below.
    
   :SIGNAL:  Equivalent to typing:  A -1 F +1.
    
DEFAULT VALUES
--------------

  ``XLIM OFF``

DESCRIPTION
-----------
  When this option is on, fixed plot limits are used for the x axis.  When this
  option is off, the limits are scaled to the data.  Fixed x limits can be used
  to "blowup" part of the data currently in memory.

EXAMPLES
--------
  In these examples we assume time is the independent variable and seconds are
  the units.::

    B 0 30: First 30 secs of the file.
    A -10 30: From 10 secs before to 30 secs after first arrival.
    T3 -1 T7: From 1 sec before T3 time pick to T7 time pick.
    B N 2048: First 2048 points of file.
    30.2 48: 30.2 to 48 secs relative to file zero.
