INPUT
-----
   :ON:  Turn display of contour lines on.
    
   :OFF:  Turn display of contour lines off.
    
   :LIST n1 n2 . nn:  Set list of linestyles to use.  Each entry in
       this list is used for the corresponding contour level. If the
       number of contour levels is larger than the number of entries in
       the list, the entire list is repeated.
    
   :REGIONS v1 v2 . vn:  Set list of contour regions.  The length of
       this list should be one less than the linestyle list.  Contour
       levels less than a contour region value are assigned the linestyle
       of the corresponding entry in the linestyle list.  Contour levels
       above the last contour region value are assigned the value of the
       last entry in the linestyle list.
    
DEFAULT VALUES

  ``ZLINES ON LIST 1``

EXAMPLES

  To set up contours which cycle between four different linestyles::

      u: ZLINES LIST 1 2 3 4

  To set contours with dotted lines representing levels below 0.0 and solid
  lines representing contours above 0.0::
