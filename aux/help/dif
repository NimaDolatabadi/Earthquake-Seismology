SUMMARY
-------
Differentiates data in memory.

SYNTAX
------

  ``DIF {TWO|THREE|FIVE}``

INPUT
-----
   :TWO:  Apply a two point difference operator.
    
   :THREE:  Apply a three point difference operator.
    
   :FIVE:  Apply a five point difference operator.
    
DEFAULT VALUES
--------------

  ``DIF TWO``

DESCRIPTION
-----------
  The two-point algorithm is::

    OUT(J)= (DATA(J+1) - DATA(J))  / DELTA

  The last output point is not defined by this algorithm.  It is also not a 
  centered algorithm.  SAC takes care of these problems by decreasing the 
  number of points in the file (NPTS) by one and by increasing the begin 
  time (B) by half the sampling interval (DELTA). 

  The three-point (centered two-point) algorithm is::

    OUT(J)= 1/2 * (DATA(J+1) - DATA(J-1)) / DELTA

  The first and last output point is not defined by this algorithm.  SAC
  decreases NPTS by 2 and increases B by DELTA.

  The five-point (centered four-point) algorithm is::

     OUT(J)=2/3 (DATA(J+1) - DATA(J-1)) / DELTA -
	    1/12 * (DATA(J+2) - DATA(J-2)) / DELTA

  The first two and last two output points are not defined by this algorithm.
  SAC applies the three-point operator to the second points from each end,
  decreases NPTS by 2, and increases B by DELTA.
