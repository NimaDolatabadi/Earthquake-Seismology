ENVELOPE
++++++++

SUMMARY
-------
Computes the envelope function using a Hilbert transform.

SYNTAX
------

  ``ENVELOPE``

DESCRIPTION
-----------
   This command computes the envelope function of the data in memory.  The
   envelope is defined by the square root of x(n)^2 + y(n)^2, where x(n)
   is the original signal and y(n) its Hilbert transform (see HILBERT).
   As with HILBERT_, very long period datashould be decimated (see DECIMATE)
   prior to processing.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENT
---------------
  The subroutines used to perform the Hilbert transform  were designed and 
  developed by Dave Harris (DBH).
