DIVF
++++

SUMMARY
-------
Divides data in memory by a set of data files.

SYNTAX
------

  ``DIVF {NEWHDR ON|OFF} filelist``

INPUT
-----
   :NEWHDR ON|OFF:  By default, the resultant file will take its
       header field from the original file in memory.
       Turning NEWHDR ON, causes the header fields to be taken from
       the new file in the filelist.
    
   :filelist:  A list of SAC binary data files.  This list may contain
       simple filenames, full or relative pathnames, and wildcard
       characters.  See the READ_ command for a complete description.
    
DESCRIPTION
-----------
   This command can be used to divide a set of files by a single file or by
   another set of files.  An example of each case is presented below.  The files
   must be evenly spaced and should have the same sampling interval and number
   of points.  This last two restrictions can be eliminated using the BINOPERR_
   command.  If there are more data files in memory than in the filelist, then
   the last file in the filelist is used for the remainder of the data files in
   memory.

EXAMPLES
--------
  To divide three files by a single file::

      u:  READ FILE1 FILE2 FILE3
      u:  DIVF FILE4

  To divide two files by two other files::

      u:  READ FILE1 FILE2
      u:  DIVF FILE3 FILE4

HEADER CHANGES
--------------
  If NEWHDR is OFF (the default) the headers in memory are unchanged).
  If NEWHDR is ON, the headers are replaced with the headers from the
  files in the filelist.

ERROR MESSAGES
--------------
- 1301: No data files read in.
- 1803: No binary data files read in.
- 1307: Illegal operation on spectral file
- 1306: Illegal operation on unevenly spaced file
- 1801: Header field mismatch:
  - either the sampling interval or the number of points are not equal.  
  - can  be controlled using the BINOPERR_ command.

WARNING MESSAGES
----------------
- 1802: Time overlap:

  - the file division is still performed.
