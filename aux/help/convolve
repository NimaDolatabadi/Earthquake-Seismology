CONVOLVE
++++++++

SUMMARY
-------
Compute the convolution of a master signal with itself and with
all other signals in memory.

SYNTAX
------

  ``CONVOLVE  {MASTER name|n},   {NUMBER n},{LENGTH ON|OFF|v},``

  ``{TYPE  RECTANGLE|HAMMING|HANNING|COSINE|TRIANGLE}``

INPUT
-----
   :MASTER name|n:  Select master file in data file list by name or
       number.  All files will be cornvolved with the MASTER.
    
   :NUMBER n:  Set number of correlation windows to be used.
    
   :LENGTH {ON}:  Turn fixed window length option on.
    
   :LENGTH OFF:  Turn fixed window length option off.
    
   :LENGTH v:  Turn fixed window length option on and change window
       length in seconds to v.
    
   :TYPE RECTANGLE:  Apply a rectangle function to each window.  This is
       equivalent to applying no function to each window.
    
   :TYPE HAMMING:  Apply a hamming function to each window.
    
   :TYPE HANNING:  Apply a hanning function to each window.
    
   :TYPE COSINE:  Apply a cosine function to each window.
    
   :TYPE TRIANGLE:  Apply a triangle function to each window.
    
DEFAULT VALUES
--------------

  ``CONVOLVE MASTER 1 NUMBER 1 LENGTH OFF TYPE RECTANGLE``

DESCRIPTION
-----------
  If there are N SAC files in memory, there are N output files that are the
  results of the convolution with MASTER.  There is no normalization.
  All signals in memory must have the same DELTA.
  
  The algorithm assumes all time series are causal, so if one wants to 
  convolve signals with a boxcar (as a method of non-causal,low-pass 
  filtering perhaps to smooth out spikes in a synthetic waveform), 
  the output signals will be time-shifted by half the width of the boxcar.
