READSUDS
++++++++

SUMMARY
-------
Read data files in PC-SUDS format from disk into memory.

**Note**  SUDS data enters SAC via SAC's CSS data buffers.  To understand how
arrivals are handled, use HELP_ READCSS_ and HELP_ PICKPREFS_.

SYNTAX
------

  ``READSUDS {MAXMEM v} {MORE} {VERBOSE ON|OFF} {SHIFT ON|OFF}``

  ``{COMMIT|ROLLBACK|RECALLTRACE} {DIR name}  filelist``

INPUT
-----
   :MAXMEM: Specify the maximum fraction of physical memory to use when
       reading large data sets. When this limit is reached, no more
       waveforms will be read, although other tables may still be read.
       The default value for MAXMEM is 0.3.
    
   :MORE:  See the READ_ command.
    
   :VERBOSE ON|OFF: If VERBOSE is ON, SAC displays extended information
       about the waveforms being read, and prints a summary of the CSS
       tables that were filled. SAC also displays a progress indicator
       for the conversion to SAC internal format.
    
   :SHIFT ON|OFF:  If SHIFT is on, the origin time is set to zero, and
       other time related header variables are shifted back to be
       consistent with the origin time.  Some of the distance related
       header variables are also affected.  SHIFT ON is the default.
    
   :COMMIT:  If the MORE option is specified, the COMMIT option commits
       headers and waveforms in SAC memory -- removing any previous
       versions of headers or waveforms from RAM -- prior to
       reading more files.  COMMIT is the default.
    
   :ROLLBACK:  If the MORE option is specified, the ROLLBACK option reverts
       to the last committed version of the header and waveform
       before reading more files.
    
   :RECALLTRACE:  If the MORE option is specified, the RECALLTRACE option:

      - reverts to the last committed version of the waveform,
      - reverts to the last committed version of those header
       	variables closely linked to the waveform,
      - commits those header variables which are loosely linked
        to the waveform.
        (use HELP_ RECALLTRACE for a list of which header variables are
        committed, and which are rolled back.)
    
      **Note**  if the MORE option is not specified, the COMMIT, ROLLBACK,
      and RECALLTRACE options have no effect.
    
    
   :DIR name:  The directory to be searched for sudsfile(s).
    
   :filelist:  The name(s) of one or more suds files.
    
DEFAULT VALUES

  ``READSUDS * MAXMEM 0.3 VERBOSE OFF COMMIT``

DESCRIPTION
-----------
   See the READ_ command.  Oct. 27, 1998 (Version 00.58)

   Any command which loads data into memory is monitored to maintain a
   level of confidence in the event infomation when transfered from the SAC
   data buffer to the CSS data buffer.  When READSUDS_ is used, the confidence
   is set to LOW, indicating that SAC should consider any matching event IDs
   as artifacts and reassign the event ID of the incoming file.  For more
   details, use HELP_ READ_.


NOTES
-----

  READSUDS_ assumes that the data are still in PC byte-order, and swaps bytes
  as necessary while reading the files.

  The following SUDS headers should be populated:

  - DESCRIPTRACE
  - STATIONCOMP
  - FEATURE
  - EVENT
  - ORIGIN

  Statident structs for a given channel must have all fields set identically
  to allow joining: i.e. dt->dt_name = fe->fe_name = sc->sc_name.

  There should be only 1 origin and 1 event in the SUDS file since PC-SUDS has
  no way to associate origins with features or descriptraces.

  ev->number must equal or->number to associate the event with the origin.

  SUDS Magnitude, Authority, Program, Instrument, and Phase codes must be 
  from the following code lists in order to translate to CSS.
