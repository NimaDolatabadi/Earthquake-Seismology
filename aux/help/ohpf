SUMMARY
-------
Opens a HYPO formatted pick file.

SYNTAX
------

  ``OHPF {file}``

INPUT
-----
   :file:  Name of file to open.  If a file by that name already exists,
       it is opened and new picks are added at the bottom.
    
DEFAULT VALUES
--------------

  ``OHPF HPF``

DESCRIPTION
-----------
  The HYPO pick file generated by SAC can be used as input to HYPO71 and
  similiar event location programs.  Picks from the automatic picker (APK) and
  manual pick plot (PLOTPK) commands are written into this file once open.  This
  file can be closed using the CHPF_ command.  Opening of a new HYPO pick file
  automatically closes the previously open one.  Opening an existing HYPO pick
  file automatically deletes the last line of the file, which should be the
  instruction card "10" that indicates the end of the HYPO input file.
  Terminating SAC also automatically closes any open pick files.  Event
  delimiters can be written into a HYPO pick file with the WHPF_ command.  See
  the reference for details on the format of each card.

ERROR MESSAGES
--------------
- 1901: Can't open HYPO pick file

  - Probably an illegal character in filename.  
  - Occasionally a system error.  If error persists contact the programmer.
