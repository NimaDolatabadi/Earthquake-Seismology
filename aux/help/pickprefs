PICKPREFS
+++++++++

SUMMARY
-------
The PICKPREFS_ command is used to control the way that SAC manages and or loads
picks from a variety of input data formats (e.g., CSS, GSE, SUDS etc...) into
the time marker variables T0 to T9 (aka. Tn).  When this option is OFF (the
default), the picks loaded into the time markers correspond to the first picks
that SAC finds in the input data.  If this options is ON, SAC will use the
preferences file described in the READCSS_ command.

Note:   Because of the structured nature of the preferences file (which aligns
specific phases with specific marker variables), and the free flowing
nature of the interactions without the preferences, a change in the
PICKPREFS_ in the middle of processing can change the picks in the
datafiles.  See the descrition below for details.

  ``PICKPREFS ON``

  ``PICKPREFS OFF``

  ``PICKPREFS``

INPUT
-----
   :ON:     instructs SAC to pass arrivals from the CSS buffer through
       the preferences file on its way to the SAC buffer.  This
       is useful in macros that require specific arrivals to be
       in specific Tn header variables.
    
   :OFF:    instructs SAC to bypass the preferences file and load the
       first 10 picks it encounters for a given file.  This is the
       default.  It allows the user to be aware of picks s/he may
       not be aware of with the PICKPREFS_ ON.
    
       If now option is provided on the commandline, PICKPREFS_
       will toggle the use of preferences file ON or OFF.

DESCRIPTION
-----------
   Since version 0.58, sac2000 has had two different header buffers: one 
   formatted according to the SAC file format, and one formatted according to 
   the relational CSS 3.0 file format.  Adding the CSS data buffer has made it 
   easier to read relational formats such as CSS, GSE, and SUDS.  Having two 
   buffers has allowed the process management commands:  COMMIT_, ROLLBACK_, and 
   RECALLTRACE_.

   One drawback of having these two buffers is the complexity of moving arrivals
   from the dynamic CSS arrival table to the rather ridged T0 - T9 picks in the
   SAC format.  This problem was solved in version 0.58 by setting in place a
   preferences file called csspickprefs.  This file is in the aux directory and
   can be overridden by writing one of your own.  For more information about how
   to use the csspickprefs file, use HELP_ READCSS_.  For details on how to 
   override the default preferences file, use HELP_ PICKAUTHOR_ or 
   HELP_ PICKPHASE_.

   The drawback of using the preferences file was that it would only accept 
   phase names and/or author names listed in the preferences file or those 
   entered at the command line with PICKPHASE_ or PICKAUTHOR_.  In other words,
   if a CSS data file from either a flat-file, or the Oracle database has a 
   pP arrival, and pP is not specified in the preferences file, the user would 
   never know that the pP is there.  The pP pick will be read into the CSS 
   data buffer in SAC, but it will not be transfered to the SAC data buffer, 
   and will not participate in any of the SAC commands.  It may be written 
   out by the WRITECSS_ command, or it may get flushed out during a COMMIT 
   command, and be lost entirely.

   The solution we have worked out is to allow the user to bypass the 
   preferences file.  In version 0.59, the default is to read the first 10 
   available picks from the CSS buffer directly into the SAC buffer whenever 
   data is transferred from the one to the other.  By use of this new command, 
   PICKPREFS_, the user can tell SAC to use the preferences file.  This is 
   useful if the user has a macro which expects to find a specific phase in 
   a specific Tn header variable.

   Data is transfered from the CSS buffer to the SAC buffer on any READCSS_, 
   READGSE_, or READSUDS_ command, as well as COMMIT_, ROLLBACK_, and RECALLTRACE_.  
   COMMIT, ROLLBACK, or RECALLTRACE get called by default by any of the following 
   commands:

    - any command that writes data (WRITE, WRITECSS_, WRITEGSE_, etc.)
    - any command that reads data with the MORE option specified
    - the SORT_ command.

   If the user alters PICKPREFS_ and or the preference settings while data is
   in the data buffers, the picks in the SAC buffer may be modified.
   Eg. if PICKPREFS_ is OFF (the default) when some SAC files are read
   with the READ_ command they may have some pP picks or some PKiKP picks which
   would be present in the Tn markers.  If PICKPREFS_ is later turned OFF, for
   a READCSS_, if pP and/or PKiKP aren't listed in the 
   preferences file, then pP and PKiKP arrivals will not be read from the 
   CSS files, and the pP and PKiKP picks in the existing data will be 
   removed from the Tn markers.
