RGLITCHES
+++++++++

SUMMARY
-------
Removes glitches and timing marks.

SYNTAX
------

  ``RGLITCHES options``

   where options are one or more of the following:

  ``THRESHOLD v``

  ``TYPE LINEAR|ZERO``

  ``WINDOW ON|OFF|pdw``

  ``METHOD ABSOLUTE|POWER|RUNAVG``

INPUT
-----
   :THRESHOLD v:  Set onset threshold level to v.  Data points whose
       absolute values are greater than or equal to v are corrected.
    
   :TYPE LINEAR:  Correct data points above the threshold by linearly
       interpolating between the data points on each side of the bad data.
    
    
   :TYPE ZERO:  Correct data points above the threshold by setting them
       to zero.
    
   :METHOD ABSOLUTE:  Corrects data points having absolute values >= the
       threshold v.
    
   :METHOD POWER:  Corrects data points where the power of the signal
       computed using a backward difference method exceeds the threshold v.
    
   :METHOD RUNAVG:  Corrects data points by calculating a running average
       and standard deviation in a window SWINLEN seconds long that moves
       from the end of the trace to the beginning of the trace in 1-point
       increments. Each new point is compared to the average, and if it
       differs by more than THRESH2 times the current standard deviation,
       and if the difference is greater than MINAMP counts, it is replaced
       by the current mean. This method is always applied to the entire
       seismogram.
   :There are three options associated with the RUNAVG method. These are:
   :SWINLEN v: Set length in seconds of running average window.
   :THRESH2 v: Set the threshold value for glitches.
   :MINAMP  v: Set the minimum amplitude for glitches.
    
    
   :WINDOW ON:  Only correct data points within the previously defined
       pdw.
    
   :WINDOW OFF:  Correct data points within the entire data file.
    
   :WINDOW pdw:  Only correct data points within the defined pdw.  A pdw
       consists of a starting and a stopping value of the independent
       variable, usually time, which defines the desired window of data that
       you wish to make measurements on.  See the CUT_ command for a
       complete explanation of how to define and use a pdw.  Some examples
       are given below.
    
DEFAULT VALUES
--------------

  ``RGLITCHES THRESHOLD 1.0E+10 TYPE LINEAR WINDOW OFF METHOD ABSOLUTE SWINLEN 0.5``

  ``THRESH2 5.0 MINAMP 50``

DESCRIPTION
-----------
  This command can be used to smooth out irregularities caused by "glitches" in
  the data acquistion system and by timing marks produced by some data
  acquistion systems.  It checks each data point to see if it's value is greater
  than or equal to the requested "onset threshold level".  It then zeros out
  these bad data points or linearly interpolates between the data point just
  before and the data point just after the bad ones.  You can have it remove
  glitches in the entire file or select a smaller portion of the file by
  setting the window.  Using this option lets you remove glitches that are
  smaller than the maximum in the entire data file.

EXAMPLES
--------
  Some examples of pdw are given below::

    B 0 30: First 30 secs of the file.
    T3 -1 T7: From 1 sec before T3 time pick to T7 time pick.
    30.2 48: 30.2 to 48 secs relative to file zero.
