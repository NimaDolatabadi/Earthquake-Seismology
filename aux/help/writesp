WRITESP
+++++++

SUMMARY
-------
Writes spectral files to disk as "normal" data files.

SYNTAX
------

  ``WRITESP {type} {COMMIT|ROLLBACK|RECALLTRACE} {OVER|filelist}``
   where type is one of the following:

  ``ASIS|RLIM|AMPH|RL|IM|AM|PH``

INPUT
-----
   :ASIS:  Write components in their present format.
    
   :RLIM:  Write real and imaginary components.
    
   :AMPH:  Write amplitude and phase components.
    
   :RL:  Write real component only.
    
   :IM:  Write imaginary component only.
    
   :AM:  Write amplitude component only.
    
   :PH:  Write phase component only.
    
   :COMMIT_:  Commits headers and waveforms in SAC memory -- removing any
       previous versions of headers or waveforms from RAM -- prior
       to writing files.  COMMIT is the default.
    
   :ROLLBACK_:  reverts to the last committed version of the header and
       waveform before writing files.
    
   :RECALLTRACE_:

      - reverts to the last committed version of the waveform,
      - reverts to the last committed version of those header
      	variables closely linked to the waveform,
      - commits those header variables which are loosely linked
      	to the waveform.
	(use HELP_ RECALLTRACE for a list of which header variables are
	committed, and which are rolled back.)

   :filelis:  A list of SAC binary data files.  This list may contain
      simple filenames and full or relative pathnames.

DEFAULT VALUES
--------------

  ``WRITESP ASIS COMMIT``

DESCRIPTION
-----------
  SAC data files may contain either time-series data or spectral data.
  Certain fields in the header distinguish between the two formats.  When you
  read (see READ) a time-series file into memory, take the fast fourier
  transform (see FFT), and write the data to disk (see WRITE), then the data on
  disk will be in the spectral format.

  Certain operations can only be performed on time-series data and
  certain operations only on spectral data.  For example, you can't apply a
  taper to spectral data files or multiply two spectral files together.  This is
  a protection mechanism built into SAC.

  Sometimes, however, you may need to perform some of these operations on
  spectral data.  To override SAC's protection mechanism, you can use this
  command to write spectral data to disk as time-series data.  Each component is
  written as a separate data file.  You may then read these files back into SAC
  and perform any operation that you wish, since SAC thinks they are time
  series data files.  Once these calculations are completed, you may write the
  modified data back to disk using the WRITE_ command.  If you wish to
  reconstruct the spectral data file, use the READSP_ command.
  To help you keep track of the data on disk, SAC appends a suffix to the
  filename you request that identifies the spectral component stored in that
  file.  The suffixes are ".RL", ".IM", ".AM", and ".PH"" for the real
  component, imaginary component, amplitude, and phase respectively.

EXAMPLES
--------
  Assume that you want to perform some operations on the spectral amplitude of
  FILE1::

    u:  READ FILE1
    u:  FFT AMPH
    u:  WRITESP OVER

  SAC will then write out two files, FILE1.AM and FILE1.PH.  Now you perform the
  operations on the amplitude file::

    u:  READ FILE1.AM
    u:  ...perform operations.
    u:  WRITE OVER

  Now the files on disk represent the modified spectral data.  If you wanted to
  reconstruct the SAC spectral data file and take the inverse transform::

    u:  READSP FILE1
    u:  IFFT
    u:  WRITE FILE2

  **Note**  for examples of the behavior of COMMIT, ROLLBACK, and 
  RECALLTRACE, see the commands of the same name.

ERROR MESSAGES
--------------
- 1301: No data files read in.
- 1305: Illegal operation on time series file


HEADER CHANGES
--------------
  B, E, and DELTA for the files on disk will contain the beginning, ending, and
  incremental frequency in Hz.
