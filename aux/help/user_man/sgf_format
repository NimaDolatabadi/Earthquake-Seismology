SAC Graphics Format (SGF)
+++++++++++++++++++++++++

Overview
--------
Each SAC Graphics File (SGF) contains all the information needed to describe 
a single picture, called a frame.  Prior to the mid90s when  the C-based
SAC2000 replaced the Fortran-based SAC, several utilities programs, external to 
SAC, were written to perform various function on an SGF file: a program to merge
up to several SGF files,  a program that directly displayed the SGF plots on the
console, a program that listed the commands encoded in an SGF file, ond  sgftops,
which converted an SGF file to a postscript file.  Most of these programs were
never converted to C, and currently, sgftops is the  only program that is 
maintained.  A description of program sgftops is given at the end of this section.

SGF Format

Overview 
--------
Each SGF contains all the information needed to describe a single picture 
(called a frame.) The filenames are normally of the form "f nnn.sgf" where 
nnn is the three digit frame number. A translation program must be written to 
convert these files to the format needed for any specific graphics device.

Physical Format
---------------
A SGF  contains variable length records with a maximum record size of 2500 
32-bit words. The first 32-bit word of each record contains the length of that 
record, including this word count. They are written in binary format for 
faster i/o. To keep them small and portable between different computer 
systems, all commands and data are stored in 16-bit integer format, 2 bytes.

Command
-------
The draw command (draw a line from the previous location to the new location) 
is the most common command. This command is simply a pair of integers giving 
the new x and y locations. These integers are in the range 0 to 32000 in the x 
direction and 0 to 24000 in the y direction. (This produces an aspect ratio of 
3:4 which maps well to most output devices.)

Other Commands 
--------------
The rest of the commands (with one exception) consist of a command 
identification number, a data count, and zero or more data words. The 
identification number is a negative integer and tells the translation program 
what operation is to be performed. The use of negative integers makes it easy 
to distinguish these commands from the draw commands. The data count is the 
number of 16-bit data words, 2 bytes, contained in this command. This format 
allows for the future addition of new commands. Also it allows each 
translation program to quickly skip over commands that it cannot process. The 
one exception to this format is the null or no-op command. This has an 
identification number of -1 and contains no data count and no data words. It 
is used to fill out a record to an even number of 32-bit words. The table on 
the next page summarizes the current commands. A plot produced from a simple 
SGF  is also included, along with a table describing the contents of that 
simple SGF.

SGF Commands Table
------------------

=== ===== ===================== ================================================
ID  Count Command               Description
=== ===== ===================== ================================================
-1  0     No-op                 No Operation 
-2  0     End                   End of picture. 
-3  2     Move                  Move to the location contained in the two (x,y) 
                                data words.
-4  1     Color                 Change color to value contained in data word. 
-5  *     Text                  Write hardware text at current location. 
                                Data count contains number of 16-bit words of 
                                text plus one. First data word is the number of 
                                characters in the text. Rest of data words 
                                contain the text, two characters per word. 
                                Last byte of last word is not significant 
                                if character count is odd. 
-6  2     Text Size             Change hardware text size. Data words contain 
                                the text width and height as integer fractions 
                                of the maximum coordinate system size (32000). 
                                For example a value of 320 would set text size 
                                to 0.01 or one percent of the full plot size.
-7  1     Line Style            Change linestyle to value contained in 
                                data word. 
-8  1     Plot Size             Change the physical size of the plot. Data 
                                word is the desired length in the x direction 
                                in 0.001 inch increments. Default value is 
                                10000 which is equivalent to 10.0 inches. None 
                                of the SGF conversion programs currently make 
                                use of this option. 
-9  1     Line Width            Change the linewidth to value contained in 
                                data word.  
-10 3     Polygon Fill          Fill a polygon with a gray value in the 
                                first data word by moving to data words 2 and
                                3. 
-11 5     Plot Filled Rectangle Fill a rectangle defined at data word 1 and 
                                2 (x, y) with a width and height data words 
                                3 and 4 and a color at data word 5. 
-12 1     Text Angle            Set the Angle of the Text
-13 4     Color Image           Plot a color image of width data word 1 and 
                                height data word 2 at data word 3 and 4 (x, y).
-14 1     color Fill flag       Fill polygon with current color.  Can be used
                                to fill positive and negative parts of waveform
                                with different colors

PROGRAM SGFTOPS
----------------
Plots from SAC can be saved to a file as a Sac Graphics Format (SGF) 
file.  Program sgfops converts a binary .sgf file to a postscript file.
As of version 101.4, sgftops can handle .sgf files with eithr endian.    

The source code can be found in sac/utils/sgftops.c, and it is built and 
put in sac/bin at the time SAC is built and installed.

Entering sgftops with no arguments produces:

Usage: sgftops sgf_file ps_file [line_width scale_id]
 
  where: 
  
         line_width = 1, 1.5, 2, 3, etc.
         
         scale_id = i  (landscape mode plus id);
         scale_id = s  (shift,rotate & scale);
         scale_id = si (s plus id).
         
time/date in id is file creation date for the .sgf file.
 
  Example: sgftops foo.sgf foo.ps 2 si
 
Produces a plot with line thick=2 and ID at the bottom.
Prompts further for translation, rotation and scale.
 
The origin of plot is lower left corner of portrait mode and angle is 
Counter Clockwise (CCW)

The reason that sgftops default is landscape is that when it was first
written (20+ years ago), the major use of a postscript file was to be
ported to a postscript printr.

PLOT-CONVERSION SCRIPTS
-----------------------
There are two scripts in sac/bin that call sgftops and produce a screen
display (sgftox.csh) or an EPS file (sgftoeps.csh).  Enter the script 
names with no arguments to get further information.  Both, as written,
require that the program "gs" is in your path. Script sgftox.csh uses gs 
to display the image on the screen, but it is easily modified to use other 
available postscript file viewers, such as gv, ggv, or evince. 
Script sgftoeps.csh can be modified to produce a PDF file if script 
epstopdf is on the system and in the path.  Note that the output file 
for both sgftoeps.csh and sgftox.csh is in portrait format.
