* If you need help ... 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.  If you have SAC working, use the help command from within SAC.  You can
    print hard-copies of the help files using printhelp.  HTML versions of the
    help files can be found at URL <http://www.iris.edu/software/sac/manual.html>.
2.  Some features of SAC are described in the CHANGES file in this directory,
    and changes in new versions are summarized in HISTORY.
3.  URL <http://www.iris.edu/software/sac/> has links to other resources 
    and information about updates.
4.  A place to share problems and find solutions is the sac-help mailing
    list: <sac-help@iris.washington.edu>.  You must be a subscriber
    to post to this listserv.  For further information, go to
    URL <http://www.iris.washington.edu/mailman/listinfo/sac-help>.
    You do not have to be a subscriber to access the list archives.
5.  Beginning in Spring 2013, IRIS has set up a SAC project in their SeisCode
    iniative: <https://seiscode.iris.washington.edu/projects/sac/>.  A section
    in this project is a Wiki that includes a Tutorial and a set of Examples.
