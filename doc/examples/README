Seismic Analysis Code Example Programs

What follows is a collection of programs that use various portions of the
sacio and sac libraries included with this distribution.  The source code
for each program in Fortran and C should be documented and the programs 
usable once compiled.  They are provided here as reference and a starting
point to create your own programs using the sacio and sac libraries.

The Makefile provided with the examples demonstrates a way to use the 
sac-config helper program to get the location and name of libraries along
with required compile flags.

Programs include:
  * Get SAC Header Variables
      - gethvc.c
      - gethvf.f
  * Read a Evenly Spaced SAC file
      - rsac1c.c
      - rsac1f.f
  * Read an Un-Evenly Spaced SAC file
      - rsac2c.c
      - rsac2f.f
  * Write a Evenly Spaced SAC file
      - wsac1c.c
      - wsac1f.f
  * Write a Un-Evenly Spaced SAC file
      - wsac2c.c
      - wsac2f.f
  * Write Another Evenly Spaced SAC file
      - wsac3c.c
      - wsac3f.f
  * Write a 2D SAC file
      - wsac4c.c
      - wsac4f.f
  * Write a collection of SAC files
      - wsac5c.c
      - wsac5f.f
  * Convolve Two SAC files
      - convolvec.c
      - convolvef.f
  * Correlate Two SAC files
      - correlatec.c
      - correlatef.f
  * Get the Envelope of a SAC file
      - envelopec.c
      - envelopef.f
  * Filter a SAC file
      - filterc.c
      - filterf.f
  * create_input.sh
      Run SAC to create SAC files that are then 
      compared to the output from each standalone program.
