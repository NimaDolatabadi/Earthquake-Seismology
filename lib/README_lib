A brief description of the libraries in sac/lib.

Libraries in this directory can be used by users to work with SAC files
using their own programs (in C or Fortran).  For examples of using these
libraries please consult the C and Fortran examples in sac/doc/examples.

sac-config
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Use to identify where the sac libraries below are located and what the 
command line options are to aid in compliation. For example to compile your
fortran program with only the sacio library try

% f77 -o my_sac_program  my_sac_program.f `sac-config --libs sacio`

or with the sacio (libsacio.a) and sac library (libsac.a)

% f77 -o my_sac_program  my_sac_program.f `sac-config --libs sacio sac`


libsacio.a and sacio.a:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
These two files are identical copies of the same library.  (File sacio.a is
put in for backwards compatibility.)  Routines from this library can be used
to read or write SAC data files, header values, and blackboard variables. 
For further information about the functions in these libraries go to the
online user's manual at URL <http://www.iris.edu/manuals/sac/manual.html> and
read the sections on Accessing Blackboard Variables In Home Grown Software
and Reading And Writing SAC Data Files In Home Grown Software.

libsac.a
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
This library was introduced in SAC version 101.2.  It is a superset of
libsacio.a, but is intended to include additional routines on operations
on data.  As of this writing, a User's Manual is in preparation for libsac.a

    Contents: xapiir - IIR filter, use this 
              firtrn - FIR filter, hilbert transform 
              crscor - Cross Correlation 
              next2  - Next Power of Two
              envelope - Envelope of a function
              
    Note: Future updates will include more legible 
          names for these functions and smaller argument
          lists for easier use, but the original
          functions will still continute to operate.
    
Again, please see the example routines in sac/doc/examples for the correct
way to use these functions.
