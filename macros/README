Introduction
------------

This directory contains a set of macros and data called by those macros.
The set of macros interactively demonstrates some of SAC's features.

Running
-------

To run the set of macros, change to the demo directory, start SAC, and call the
macro:

sac/macros: cd demo
sac/macros/demo: sac
 SEISMIC ANALYSIS CODE [05/02/2013 (Version 101.6)]
 Copyright 1995 Regents of the University of California

SAC> m demo

Macro demo sequentially calls three other macros: read, plot, and filter.
Commands will be displayed on the SAC> screen as they are executed.  At several
points, "pause" is displayed, and the user must hit a carriage return in the
SAC> window to proceed.  After the second "pause" a plot image will be 
displayed on the screen -- probably overlapping the SAC> window.  Because you
will be producing several plots during this run, an efficient way to progress
through the operations is to move the windows on your screen so they do not
overlap.. Clicking on the border of the window with the SAC> prompts makes it
the active window (which is necessary for the program to proceed).
After finishing with macro read, macros plot and filter are called.

Subdirectory results/ should be empty before the demo macro is run.  PDF copies
of the six plots created by the macros are created and put in results/ using
the SAC command saveimg.  Also put into results/ is a command-line history file
named demo_run.txt, which is created by command transcript.  (The syntax of the
calls to these commands can be seen by looking at the macros, and further
information about them can be gotten from the help files saveimg and
transcript.) Copies of the PDF files and transcript output file are in 
directory successful_run_results as a reference.

History
-------

The original version of the macros were written in the early 90s when Sun
Solaris was the most used platform, sunwindows was the default screen display,
and SGF files were the only way to get hard copies of SAC-created plots.  
For v101.6, the macros have been updated and are included because they remain 
a potentially useful that for both showing off some of SAC's capabilities and 
providing some sample coding in macros.

The original version included a second set of macros that demonstrated some of
SAC's features.  They are not included here because there are now other suites 
of macros and programs that serve this purpose.  These include:

  1. Seismic Analysis Code Example Program (sac/doc/examples/README)
  2. https://seiscode.iris.washington.edu/projects/sac/wiki/Examples
  3. sac/t/testsuite/README.check (currently available only with the source 
     distribution)
