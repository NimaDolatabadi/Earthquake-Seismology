This file is parameter file for asso. The file can be in working directory
or DAT.
Only the lines with recognized keywords and a non blank field 
under Par 1 will be read. The comments have no importance. Lines with 
keywords MAGS MDIF DIST TIME must come grouped 
together in increasing magnitude order. Parameters for these lines are: 
Reference magnitude, maximum magnitude difference of corresponding 
event to merge, distance(km) and time(sec).
All number must be real numbers. Columns Par 1-Par 4 start in 
columns 41,51,61 and 71 respectively.
All keywords in capital letters.
"Hypocentral" distance is calculated assuming main shock is at depth h1
and associated event at depth h2, epicentral distance at dist so
hypocentral distance is = sqrt(dist*dist+(h2-h1)*(h2-h1)).
If event is larger than largest event in table, values for largest event is used.
If event is smaller than smallest event in table, event is not considered for merging. 

Parameter values are interpolated for magnitudes between the ones given.

The values shown in debug output are the interpolated values.
The MAGS MDIF DIST TIME are mag of main shock, corresponding maximum 
mag difference of associated event, maximum distance (km) and time(sec)
differences. 

The MAX DEPT DIFFERENCE will consider only events with a depth
difference less than MAX DEPT DIFFERENCE as possible associated events.


The largest of the associated events is written out first
