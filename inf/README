* Overview
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
This README file is in the top directory (named sac) of a directory tree
that has either been installed from a SAC source distribution or
produced by the expansion of a SAC binary-distribution compressed tar file.
There are SAC binary-distributions for the following operating systems:

1. Mac OS 10.6 (64 bit): will run on 10.7 or 10.8 (if one has downloaded and 
installed X or XQuartz, which no longer come on the installation discs).
2. Linux 64-bit: built on CentOS release 5.9 (Final).

Other platforms or operating systems must be built from the source code.  
Successful builds for v101.6 have been made and tested on Solaris 2.8 (big
endian) and 2.11 (x86); Linux 32-bit; and Mac 10.4 (both ppc and intel).
Because of licensing issues, a Cygwin binary distribution cannot be
provided.

Optimization was not used in any of these builds. For more information on 
supported operating systems, see HISTORY and CHANGES in this directory.
It is assumed you have X windows on your system.  On Mac OS 10.7.2 or
later, one must have xcode installed.

* New features with this release
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
New features with this release are listed in the HISTORY file, and major
features are described in more detail in the CHANGES file and in the help
files, which can be accessed from within SAC or read online (HTML format) at
URL <http://www.iris.edu/software/sac/manual.html>.

As discussed in CHANGES, a feature new with v101.5 is the capability to save
plots in alternative file formats to SGF.  One of these formats is PNG, but for
v101.6 the default is not to include PNG support because (1) the resolution is
far worse than options PDF and PS, and (2) the default PNG libraries are 
dynamic libraries so that a binary SAC distribution built on one computer may
not be portable.  PNG support can be included with the configure option 
--enable-png.  (One needs the source distribution to do this.)

                     On some Windows Cygwin installations, aux is renamed
                     winaux. (This depends on the version of Cygwin and how
                     SAC was built on those systems.)

sac/Editline.license License for Editline for Command line edits and history

* Environment Setup
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
The system has to be able to find the binaries and scripts that are in
SACHOME/bin, and the environmental variable SACAUX must be set to SACHOME/aux. 

In addition, there are options within SAC that can be set through environmental
variables. In SACHOME/bin the scripts sacinit.csh (csh and tcsh) and
sacinit.sh (bash) contain lines that set up your environment.

If the distribution was built from sources, these scripts were created during
the installation of the SAC package and already have the correct path for the
computer on which it was built.

If the distribution is binary, you may need to edit the directory given for
SACHOME.  See the script for your shell for descriptions of the options and
the syntax for the commands.

If SACHOME is /usr/local/sac and the sacinit file is modified accordingly,
to set the path and other options for SAC, do the following:

  For csh and tcsh, edit ~/.cshrc adding the lines
        setenv SACHOME /usr/local/sac
        source ${SACHOME}/bin/sacinit.csh

     After saving and exiting the file, enter
        source ~/.cshrc

  For bash, edit ~/.bashrc adding the lines
        export SACHOME=/usr/local/sac
        . ${SACHOME}/bin/sacinit.sh

    After saving and exiting the file, enter
        . ~/.bashrc

If one wants to change any of the options or if more than one person is using
the same SAC distribution, it is best to copy the path and environment
lines directly into their own shell initialization file.

* Initialization macro
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
It is recommended that each user create an initialization macro that runs 
whenever SAC is started.  To do this, one creates a startup macro file (e.g.,
/usr/local/macros/init.m) and aliases SAC as follows:

      alias sac '${SACHOME}/bin/sac /usr/local/macros/init.m'

Here is a sample initialization macro:

   lh columns 2 files none; qdp 10000 ; xdiv power off ; xlabel 'Time (sec)'
   setmacro /usr/local/macros ; transcript history file ./.sachist

For the meaning of these entries (lh, qdp, xdiv, xlabel, setmacro,
transcript), use the help feature in SAC.  For further discussion of the
transcript command and command-line editing, see SACHOME/utils/README_utils.

* Matlab Interface
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Solaris
  Set LD_LIBRARY_PATH to include matlab shared object libraries:
  setenv LD_LIBRARY_PATH ${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}:/usr/local/matlab/extern/lib/sol2
- Mac OS X
  The DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH needs to be set
  setenv DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH
         ${DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH}:/Applications/MATLAB74/bin/maci

  These path may differ on your machine. The path needs to include
   - The Matlab Engine Library (libeng)
   - The Matlab Executable Library (libmex)

File utils/README_utils describes some Matlab macros provided by a user.

* If you need help ...
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.  If you have SAC working, use the help command from within SAC.  You can
    print hard-copies of the help files using printhelp.  HTML versions of the 
    help files can be found at <http://www.iris.edu/software/manual.html>.
2.  Some features of SAC are described in the CHANGES file in this directory,
    and changes in new versions are summarized in HISTORY.
3.  URL <http://www.iris.edu/software/sac/> has links to other resources and
    information about updates.
4.  A place to share problems and find solutions is the sac-help llistserv:
    <sac-help@iris.washington.edu>.  You must be a subscriber
    to post to this listserv.  For further information, go to
    URL <http://www.iris.edu/mailman/listinfo/sac-help>.
    You do not have to be a subscriber to access the list archives.
5.  Beginning in Spring 2013, IRIS has set up a SAC project in their SeisCode
    initiative: <https://seiscode.iris.washington.edu/projects/sac/>.  
    A section in this project is a Wiki that includes a Tutorial and a
    set of Examples.

you -- or whomever installed SAC on your system -- accepted the license 
agreement at the time the IRIS software request form was submitted.)
