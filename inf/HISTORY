        * BUG FIX: Spectrogram output when changing ymin-ymax range
        * UPDATE:  In saveimg, for PS and PDF, do not draw background fill if 
          it is white.  This means that the option alpha off must be used in 
          programs like imagemagick/display.
        * UPDATE: Minor changes to the 10 linestyles so consistent among all 
          graphics devices (previously, only four were available on some 
          devices).  Lengthened line segments in fileid location -- 
          previously too short to distinguish among them
        * UPDATE: Update to Readme.buildsac to incorporate information 
          regarding memory checkers and changes to the source affecting the

          compiling with either gcc, clang, or optimized version of gcc or clang
          - gcc 4.2.1 (Apple Build 5666)
          - clang 3.1
        * UPDATE: Added FREE(x) macro to check if memory is defined
        * UPDATE: Added upward-pointing vertical direction to file_format 
          - C.Tape

          - Documentation Updates
          - Help File Updates
          - pltext depended on uninitialized values:
            gdm/text.c -- initialize xdel and ydel
            textbox: make sure text strings exist before plotting and using
            set filename to the first display id, always
          - wsac3() changed to wsac0() is doc/examples/
          - File pointer did not get put back to the beginning of the file 
            in PDF writing
          - Print warning for interpolate if new delta is greater than 
            current delta and delta is even
          - If master file is the shorter length file, then a out of bound error
            occurs, possibly causing a segmentation fault.  Fix by only copying
            the length of the file, not the maximum possible length of any file.
        * UPDATE:  Added alternative system() command to not stall in valgrind
        * UPDATE:  pytest.sh removed help from list of tests of valgrind is run
          pytest.py runs quietly with valgrind and suppresses X11 Font Errors
          Added valgrind.x11.suppress file to suppress X11 Font Errors
          pytest.py displays the file could not read if it does not exist
        * UPDATE:  Changed zfiles to use glob() rather than popen("ls -d")
          as valgrind stalls on popen(), it is cleaner than using a piped command
        * UPDATE:  Added SACTESTS and SACVALGRIND as options to
          Run individual tests SACTESTS=testname
          Run tests within valgrind SACVALGRIND=1
        * UPDATE:  Moved rstrip() and lstrip() into bot/indexb.c
          - co/zopens.c and co/znfiles.c now take a filename
            copy it and strip all whitespace to the right.
        * UPDATE:  Introduction of strcut() to extract a string from a 
          Fortran character array
          Results is null-terminated and user must free the string
          Removed many of the messy constructs like:
            strncpy((str = malloc(ic2-ic1+2)),in+ic1,ic2-ic1+1);
            str[ic2-ic1+1]='/0';
        * BUG FIX: gcc -Wall -Wextra -O2, 
          clang Address Sanitizer, valgrind, clang Static Analyzer

          - Fixes to warnings and errors from clang v1.7 (LLVM2.9)
        * BUG FIX: Line Styles:
          - Make the maximum number of linestyles to loop over to be 10, it was 4
          - Modify PDF, PS, and X11 to have the same line styles as SGF.
          - Always use drawpoly in src/gdm/polyline.c otherwise linestyles 
            are not plotted correclty
            Linestyles were destroyed as each point is plotted individually
          - PNG will match X11
        * BUG FIX: Postscript Plotting: Changed ps_moveto() and ps_lineto() 
          from int to float for "more correct" and "better looking" plots
        * BUG FIX: FileID
          Edit location and length symbols and line segments in FILEID for 
          PDF and PS
          Testsuite should include tests of the output formats
          - line inc on
          - symbol inc on
        * BUG FIX: Fix for failure on strncpy() that exceeds the size of 
          destination string
          in src/fdm/rcdi.c for KEVNM.  Uses memcpy()
        * BUG FIX: Fix warnings about "error: initializer element is not 
          constant" (llvm-gcc-4.2 on OSX 10.7)
        * BUG FIX: Initialize runtext in src/co/zrun.c so that subscpy() can 
          determine the length of output string
        * BUG FIX: changestring() and deletestring() now do not call strcut() if
          the start is after the end (or the end if before the start)
          strcut() reports errors directly to standard output
        * BUG FIX: Fix logic in funcgen command as to how time in calculated 
          to avoid round off-errors.  Has implications to tests that use the 
          funcgen command to generate data.
          Round off error was also fixed in
          - src/scm/lifite.c (linear least squares fit)
          - src/scm/xrtr.c (remove trend)
        * BUG FIX: Check output of dblMergeTrees(). If output is the tree to 
          be merged, then do not delete the tree as the parent tree did not 
          exist.  If the output and the merge tree are different then delete 
          the tree.

           - fix error-handling problems in sgf_print() and tmpfile_create()
             tmpfile_create() would've passed NULL to mkstemps() if 
             strdup() failed.
             sgf_print() would've passed NULL to unlink if 
             tmpfile_create() failed.
             It also would've returned an uninitialized variable (retval) 
             if sgf_to_ps() returned a non-zero value.
           - fix error-handling problems in sgf_to_ps() and ps_print()
             Neither function checked to see if asprintf() succeeded.
             ps_print() could've returned an uninitialized variable 
             if sac_print_disable
           - fix logic error in pickwindows(), remove unused variable lxlims
           - fix possible use of uninitialized vars,

           - fix possible use of uninitialized variable in worlddraw()
           - fix possible use of uninitialized variable in worldmove()
           - initialize lempty in xppk()
           - stop reading from uninitialized array, cleanup of setctable3()
           - fix signed/unsigned mismatch in setctable3()
           - fix uninitialized pointer dereference in encodeHeader() 
             in utils/bbfswap.c, It doesn't look like the code that 
             dealt with the "p" pointer actually did

2007/11/20 Version 101.1
	* Supported Platforms: Solaris, Linux (32/64 bit), Mac OS X
	  ( PPC and i686, <= 10.4 ), and Windows under Cygwin.
	  - Compilation on 64 bit systems (Linux) requires specific options 
	    to the ./configure script to create a 32 bit version on a 64 bit 
	    platform.  Please consult the Readme.buildsac for details.  
	  - OSX/i686 builds are not successful using gcc 3 (10.4 and below)
	  - OSX/PPC builds are successful using gcc 3 or gcc 4. (10.4 and 
	    below).
	       If one wants to use the sacio library with Fortran calls,
	       one may need to compile those Fortran programs using gcc 3.
	       See Readme for details.
	  - OSX 10.5 is not supported at this time.
	  - Build are reported to work on OSX 10.2, but required compilation
	    on that platform.
	  - Linux builds are successful using gcc3 or gcc 4, but builds on
	    CentOS 5 will not work on machines running CentOS 4.
          - Windows versions are available under the Cygwin Environment and 
	    must be compiled by each user due to licensing restrictions.
	    There is a separate source distribution for Cygwin (because aux
	    cannot be used as a directory name in Windows).
	* Changed Build System to ./configure / autotools method
	  This should provide a more robust way to create and install SAC
	* Updated: sgftox.csh change postscript viewer to ghostscript
	* Addition of libsacio.a, same file as sacio.a.  Changed to
	  ease compilation.
	* Added wsac3: same as wsac0, but writes out all current header 
	  variables.  However, on the Mac PPC platform, there are 
	  compatibility problems with gcc and g77.  See Readme for details.
	  Added wsac3 description to  aux/help/user_man/10appendix.
	* BUG FIX: Sort command now works with the SeisMgr database off
	* BUG FIX: Parsing of polezero files now works for lengthy
	  character strings.
	* BUG Fix: Parsing of multiple blackboard variables fixed
	* BUG FIX: Large Crosshairs work again
	  Enable by defining the environment variable 
	  SAC_PPK_LARGE_CROSSHAIRS to 1
	* ENHANCEMENT: Zoom within PPK now does not care about pick order
	* BUG FIX: o changed to odelta to avoid a conflict
	* BUG FIX: isNaN() unsuitable for double, changed to system
	  command isnan().  Found while checking polezero constants.

-----------------------------
| v0.58 (April 29, 1999)
-----------------------------

1) New Capabilities / Added Commands
    READCSS and WRITECSS have been rewritten from the ground up to provide
    complete CSS 3.0 compatibility.
    For details use HELP READCSS and HELP WRITECSS.

    COMMIT, ROLLBACK, and RECALLTRACE (RECALL for short) are three new commands
    which add flexibility to the process of analyzing data.  SAC now has two
    data storage locations in RAM, the original working memory that SAC has
    always had, and an I/O buffer.  After reading a set of files (which puts
    identical information in both working memory and the I/O buffer), the user
    can process the files in working memory while leaving the I/O buffer
    untouched.  The two locations contain information from the same files, but
    the one is processed and the other is not.  The user can choose from the
    following options:
	- ROLLBACK copies the unprocessed files from the I/O buffer to
	  working memory, reverting to the previous state,
	- COMMIT copies the processed files from working memory into the
	  I/O buffer, commiting the changes in both locations,
	- RECALLTRACE rolls back the waveform certain header fields which are
	  tightly linked to the waveform, while commiting the remaining
	  header fields; the user can filter a file, use PPK to get picks, and
	  use RECALLTRACE to get the original waveform back but keep the picks.
    For more information use HELP COMMIT, HELP ROLLBACK, and HELP RECALLTRACE.

    TRAVELTIME TAUP:  TRAVELTIME now takes the TAUP option, specifying that the
    named file is of the format output by taup_curve:  a traveltime estimator by
    Philip Crotwell at the University of South Carolina. The PICKS option saves
    requested picks in specified header fields T0-T9. Use HELP TRAVELTIME for
    details.

    TRANSFER now can read response information from a Frequency/Amplitude/Phase
    (FAP) file.  Also, the DBASE option sends SAC searching the Oracle database
    for pertinent EVALRESP, FAP, or POLEZERO files for instrument response.
    Use HELP TRANSFER.

    SORT allows the user to sort the files in memory according to the header
    fields.  It can sort in ascending or decending order, and can sort on as
    many as five header fields at once.  For details, use HELP SORT.

    CUTIM allows the user to cut the file in memory.  Also allows the user to
    cut multiple segments of a file into multiple files.  For details use
    HELP CUTIM.

    READGSE and READSUDS were added to read the GSE2.0 data format, and the SUDS
    data format.  For details use HELP READGSE and HELP READSUDS.

    WRITEGSE now writes data in the GSE2.0 format. For details use HELP
    WRITEGSE.

    READ now take a SEGY option allowing it to read segy files of the type
    supported by IRIS/PASSCAL.  For details use HELP READ.

    READ now takes an ALPHA option to allow it to read SAC formated alphanumeric
    files such as those written with WRITE ALPHA.  To avoid some of the
    confusion, the READALPHA command (which doesn't read SAC formated
    alphanumeric files, but tabular collumn data) has been renamed READTABLE
    (or RTAB for short).  For details, use HELP READ or HELP READTABLE.

    WHITE (or PREWHITE) has been added as a command callable from either SAC's
    main shell, or from the SPE subprocess.  It performs the same processing as
    the PREWHITEN option of the COR command.  Use HELP WHITEN for details.

    FILTERDESIGN is working again.  FILTERDESIGN plots a graphical
    representation of a filter, the parameters of which are entered by the user
    at the command line. The FILE option saves Impulse Response, Group Delay,
    and Amplitude and Phase information in SAC files.  The Use HELP FILTERDESIGN
    for details.

    PRINT option has been added to the following commands:  BEGINFRAME, PLOT,
    PLOT1, PLOT2, BBFK, FILTERDESIGN, PLOTALPHA, PLOTCOR, PLOTDY, PLOTPM,
    PLOTRECORDSECTION, IMAGE, SONOGRAM, and SPECTROGRAM.  When
    used with the BEGINFRAME command, it signals the ENDFRAME command to print
    the resultant plot.  All other commands simply print the resultant plot.
    It optionally takes the name of a printer as a parameter.  It will write
    SGF files in the /tmp directory.  Use the HELP command on any of the listed
    commands for details.

    PRINT command will print the most recent SGF file produced.  This presumes
    an SGF file has been produced since SAC2000 was booted.  For details use
    HELP PRINT.

    The SGF command now takes an OVERWRITE option.  When OVERWRITE is on, each
    SGF file written overwrites the previous SGF file.  This saves space on the
    hard disk, but the files disappear.

    PRINTHELP hardcopies of help files.  Use HELP PRINTHELP for details.

2) Important Changes
    The maximum number of files that can be read into SAC2000 has been
    increased from 200 to 1000.

    Now that there are two memory locations where each file is stored, it is
    important for certain SAC commands, that the two copies of each file
    be identical.  For this reason, the following commands will automatically
    perform either a COMMIT, ROLLBACK, or RECALLTRACE before executing:
    MERGE
    DATAGEN MORE
    READ MORE
    READTABLE MORE (formerly READALPHA)
    READCSS MORE
    READDB MORE
    READGSE MORE
    READHDR MORE
    READSDD MORE
    READSUDS MORE
    SORT
    WRITE
    WRITECSS
    WRITEHDR
    WRITESP
    WRITESTACK
    In each case, COMMIT is the default, but options allow the user to change to
    ROLLBACK or RECALLTRACE.  Use the HELP command for further information.

    The commands MULF, DIVF, ADDF, and SUBF have -- in previous versions -- left
    the user with the headers from the file being added (or what have you) in,
    as opposed to keeping the original header.  This version and future versions
    will keep the original header by default.  An option has been provided to
    allow the user to keep the new header instead.  For details use HELP MULF,
    HELP DIVF, HELP ADDF, or HELP SUBF.

    DELETECHANNEL now accepts a range of filenumbers using the dash (-).
    For details, use HELP DELETECHANNEL.

    The MERGE command has been updated to allow files with overlapping data
    points to merge as long as the overlapping points line up exactly.

    PLOT2 now plots spectral files (IRLIM and IAMPH) as relative whether the
    RELATIVE or ABSOLUTE option is selected.  This is because frequency is
    not measured on an arbitrary scale as is time.  For details use HELP PLOT2.

    sacio.a is a new library available on our ftp site which a whole lot smaller
    than sac.a and allows full use of all the SAC I/O routines written up in the
    SAC manual.  These routines can be called transparently from either C or
    FORTRAN code.  Use HELP INPUT_OUTPUT and HELP APPENDIX for details.

3) Bug Fixes
    Modified SPE subprocess to allow windows greater than 2048.

    Fixed a bug in e1 compressed data expansion

    Fixed a bug that prevented SAC from reading from links.

-----------------------------
| v0.57
-----------------------------

0) New Area Code
    On March 14, 1998, the area code for Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory,
    and the SAC developement team, changed from 510 to 925.  Mandatory dialing
    of the new area code begins September 12.

1) New Capabilities / Added Commands
    READDB gets data from an Oracle database.  Note that this capability is only
    available on the Sun/Solaris version of SAC2000.  To get READDB working,
    the executable sac2000.57.oracle.Z, must be downloaded from the ftp site
    and uncompressed (see the README file which came with the distribution).
    The user also needs access to a compatibly formatted Oracle database.
    For details on how the command works, use HELP READDB.
      A note to the Oracle database manager:  The READDB command will work with
      a database that strictly conforms to the CSS 3.0 data format.
      Alternatively, if an EVID column is added (and populated) in the WFDISC
      table, READDB will work, and have increased performance for some queries.

2) Bug Fixes
    Fixed bug in p2 which prevented fileid from plotting properly if it was
    set to a header variable.

    Fixed bug in central plotting routine which was plotting data points off
    the right side of the plot.

    The DC abbreviation had been overloaded, refering to the DELETECHANNEL
    command in the main part of SAC2000 and to the DELTACHECK command in the
    Seismogram Stacking Subprocess.  DC no longer refers to the DELTACHECK
    command.  Users wishing to use the DELTACHECK command in SSS should
    spell out the whole command name.

    Fixed a bug in SPECTROGRAM which was producing errors in header fields.

    Fixed a bug in 3c which didn't update SAC data in MATLAB when the engine
    was left running between calls.

-----------------------------
| v0.56a
-----------------------------
1) The sac I/O library routines have been rewritten and are included in the
    SAC library called sac.a.  sac.a is available on the SAC2000 ftp site. Now
    there is one set of I/O routines which can be called from either C or
    FORTRAN programs.  See help input_output, help blackboard, and help
    appendix.

-----------------------------
| v0.56 and prior
-----------------------------

1) New Capabilities

  READCSS does a more comprehensive job of reading CSS 3.0 flat files.
  see help readcss

  READCSS can handle the e1 compressed format.

  SAC has a MATLAB interface, allowing users with MATLAB to use its
  capabilities within SAC.  See help mat.

  3C is a new three-component processing capability in SAC2000.
  It allows the user to interactively estimate a signals polarization
  and wave type (P or S).  It can also be run in batch mode.
  See help 3c

  Users who don't have MATLAB, can still use SAC.

  The external function capability, which allows users to design their
  own sac commands, has been enhanced and we have included an example
  external function called flipxy with the distribution.  This function
  allows the users to transpose XY data, and provides an example to the user of
  how to write and install an external command into SAC.

  WIENER now checks to make sure that the noise window is within the data
  window.


2) Added Commands
  DELETECHANNEL (DC) removes a file from SAC's memory.  see help deletechannel

  FILENUMBER (FN) allows the plots to display the file number of each file.
  This can be used to determine the number of a file to be deleted with
  DELETECHANNEL.  see help filenumber.

  DELETESTACK performs the same function as DELETECHANNEL, but it can be called
  from within the Signal Stacking Subprocess (SSS).

  PICKAUTHOR and PICKPHASE are used to modify the behavior READCSS uses in
  reading picks from the .arrival file (CSS 3.0 flat files).
  see help readcss, help pickauthor, and help pickphase


3) Added Options
  BB option for TRAVELTIME command saves a time on the black board.
  see help traveltime

  If the DISTANCEWINDOW command is called with two real numbers, it will behave
  as though the FIXED option is specified.

  The utility SGFPLOT can take the CONSTRAIN option which constrains the aspect
  ratio of the plot to 3/4 (Thanks to Arthur Snoke).


4) Bug Fixes
  A bug in TRAVELTIME prevented traveltime curves in ascii files from plotting
  correctly in portrait mode.  This has been corrected.  see help traveltime

  SYNCHRONIZE was synchronizing files properly only if they had the same date.
  Files with different dates were having the begintimes all set to zero.  This
  has been corrected.  For the user who wants the begin times set to zero, the
  BEGIN option has been added to this command.  see help SYNCHRONIZE

  A bug prevented users who had changed the color table to return to the default
  color table (table 17).  This has been corrected.  see help loadctable

  The PLOT1 command would not utilize the relative option if XLIM was set.  This
  has been corrected.

  The CUT command now cuts precisely where the user requests.


----------------------------------------------------------------------
| Recent developments in and enhancements to SAC (v55 and prior) |
----------------------------------------------------------------------

A number of new features, recent developments or improvements
are briefly summarized below.  For the most up-to-date information
on specific commands consult the on-line documentation.
Additional information can also be found on our web page at
http://www-ep.es.llnl.gov/tvp/sac.html

One of our recent developments is an interface to matlab that will
allow you to run matlab scripts from within SAC2000 on data in
memory.  Our matlab interface currently provides direct access
to sac waveform data and all relevant header fields.
Development of this interface is still in progress.  In our next release,
the header will be broken into well defined structures for easier
access and we are also considering adding access to SAC2000's blackboard.
For more information on this feature type "help mat" inside
SAC2000.

Another useful feature that many of our long-time users may
not be aware of is our interface to the Generic Mapping Tools
(GMT) codes which allows the user to make quick maps of stations,
and events, where the event symbols can be scaled by magnitude
or residual.

Users can also develop their own sac commands based on
standalone C or FORTRAN programs.  These commands run within
SAC2000 sharing waveform and header data in SAC2000's internal memory.
For more information type help "external_interface"

Our spectrogram/sonogram commands are also a popular feature.
These commands produce properly registered high resolution
color spectrograms and binary sonograms,


*** The following is a very brief summary of some ***
*** of the recent developments/improvements.      ***
***            Commands are in all caps.          ***

LOADCTABLE (lct): a selection of 17 colortables to use with 3-D images
		  (e.g., spectrograms, fk, etc...)

BBFK and BEAM:  Use lat and lon in headers or user7, user8, user9, to
        	   	compute relative station locations.
BBFK: 	Wavenumber and azimuth at maximum power are written to blackboard
variables
CORRELATE: output timing made consistent with conventional applications.

(default is on)
	Scale on or off to scale the data by the calib constant 
(default is off)
	Added GSE3.0 format.
WRITECSS: write CSS3.0 data from sac.
WRITE: Write to xdr format for tranformation to linux version.
        kstcmp option uses to kstnm and kcmpnm to define file name.
