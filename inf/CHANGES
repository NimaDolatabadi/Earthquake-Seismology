Please see file HISTORY for list of official release and 
a summary of bug fixes and enhancements made between releases.

2013/06 Version 101.6 released

For v101.6, pre-built binaries are provided for only two platforms:

1. Mac OS 10.6 (64 bit): will run on 10.7 or 10.8.
   The Mac build does not use /opt/local (macports default).
2. Linux 64-bit: built on CentOS release 5.8 (Final).

Other platforms or operating systems must be built from the source code.  
Successful builds for v101.6 have been made and tested on Solaris 2.8 (big
endian) and 2.11 (x86); Linux 32-bit; and Mac 10.4 (both ppc and intel).
Because of licensing issues, a Cygwin binary distribution cannot be
provided.

IRIS has updated their Web site so that several URLs have changed.  Hopefully 
we have the corect links in our documentation.

Updated Using SAC help files. (See the HTML versions at
<http://www.iris.edu/software/sac/manual.html>.)

Beginning in Spring 2013, IRIS has set up a SAC project in their SeisCode
initiative: <https://seiscode.iris.washington.edu/projects/sac/>.

Replaced the obsolete macros/ subdirectory with a sample set that is up to date.

Disabled PNG and XFT for default builds
          - To turn on PNG: ./configure --enable-png
          - To turn on XFT: ./configure --enable-xft

Fill positive and negative portions of seismograms (through the LINE command)

New command parser (see HISTORY for details)

At the 2012 annual meeting of the Eastern Section of the SSA (Blacksburg, VA),
there was a presentation that discussed the fact that precision in timing and 
(perhaps) distance has improved beyond the SAC single-precision capability.  
For example, because SAC stores time variables in single precision, to resolve 
times to less than 0.001 s, the total time must be less than 16,384 s = 4.5 hours.
The presentation can be downloaded from URL 
<https://seiscode.iris.washington.edu/attachments/275/es-ssa-2012.pdf>.  
The only improvement in precision for v101.6 is that blackboard numerical values 
are now stored as double-precision floating-point numbers.

Increaqsed default plot linewidths for program sgftops to make them better
match the output from SAC command saveimg.

Richard Godbee and Brian Savage found and fixed MANY errors and
warnings through the SAC tree using clang static analyzer (v3.1), 
clang address sanitizer (v3.1),  and valgrind with compilation flags 
-Wall -Wextra.  Details are given in HISTORY.

2012/02 Version 101.5c released

Fixes a bug introduced in v101.5 when writing SAC headers (wh), and a bug that
led to an incorrect error message when interpolate was applied to LEVEN FALSE
files.

Fixed memory errors related to plotting labels that could lead to crashes.

Two HELP files were incomplete: input_output and sacio.  These had listings for
sample programs that did not get input correctly.  Also, sacio is about the use
of the SAC library for processing data using SAC functions (such as filtering
or correlation) in C or FORTRAN programs.  It has been renamed saclib and the
reference from the online help top page has been changed accordingly.

The Linux 64-bit binary written using Ubuntu did not work on Centos 5.x systems.  
One built on Centos 5.7 works on Centos 5 and 6 and on Ubuntu.

2011/11 Version 101.5 released

Starting with version 101.5, we do not give a date/author for changes made.  As
noted above, the HISTORY file summarizes in one or two lines each bug fix and 
enhancement made between versions.  Usually the updated (or new) HELP file 
provides details and explanations about usage, but for a few items we feel some
further explanation is called for. 

ADDITIONAL PLOT-FILE FORMATS: Several users have requested that SAC be able to 
produce directly plot files in formats used by other applications.  Although we
provide programs and scripts that can convert SGF files into Postscript (and to
EPS or PDF if one has Ghostscript), this process requires extra steps and the 
fonts are vector-drawn rather than true Postscript fonts.  Command [SAVE]IMG 
(the [] indicate the SAVE alias for SAVEIMG) allows one to create PNG, XPM, PS, 
and PDF plots in a single line.  Fonts in the PS and PDF files are true 
Postscript fonts.  See the HELP file for further details.  To build SAC from
sources, one must have libpng installed to be able to write PNG files.  The
binary distributions are built using only a static libpng to maximize portability. 
(The license for libpng has no restrictions for uses such as in SAC.)

TRAVELTIME: Although the traveltime command has existed since SAC2000, it was 
not robust.  The method used is one developed in 1991 when the IASP91 velocity 
model was introduced and requires reading two binary files.  As written, the 
command tried to use the big-endian form of the binary forms even if the 
computer architecture was little endian.  The updated traveltime does 
byte-swapping if needed and can handle EVDP in either meters or kilometers.  
The earlier traveltime had three "syntax" choices, but only the first syntax is
supported in the current version. The current version runs within SSS or 
without going into SSS.  See the Help file for details.

ANNOTATED POLEZERO FILES:  In v101.4 a bug fix made it so that SAC could 
interpret lines that started with * as comments.  In program RDSEED v5.2  and the
SACPZ Web service <http://www.iris.edu/ws/sacpz/>, each set of poles and zeros 
will be annotated (using comment lines) with details that identify the 
associated time series and other related metadata).  Polezero files can now 
contain multiple "epochs" in a single file: more than one set of poles and 
zeros differentiated by the time range for which they were valid for a given 
station, component and location (an identification tag coded in the SAC header 
as KHOLE).  Version 101.5 of SAC can interpret such files correctly. 
Note that if KCMPNM in the SAC header does not agree with the * COMPONENT (v5.0) 
or * CHANNEL (v5.2) line, SAC TRANSFER will return an error message: 
"ERROR 2114: No response information for this channel in response file."

FUNCGEN SEISMOGRAM:  As mentioned below, the origin time had been changed in 
seismogram so that P arrivals would be at the first break for the EVDP of 0.0.
Even though the actual event probably had a focal depth of 2.4 km (George 
Helfrich), this was for a local velocity model with several crustal layers.  
We decided to set EVDP and adjust the origin time so that the P arrival came in
at the first break using the AK135 or IASP91 velocity models.  We did this 
because we use it in our examples in the traveltime help file, and as there are
no other clear arrivals in the seismogram, the actual EVDP and GCARC do not 
really matter.  For the next update, we hope to have real data with multiple 
arrivals.  (We also took out the displayed T arrival, which had no obvious meaning.)

2010/06/07 Version 101.4 released

2010/06/02 Brian Savage <savage@uri.edu>

    * Changes to code in makefiles to make sure Cygwin will compile correctly for
      both version 1.5 and 1.7
    * Introduced a docutils package that can produce HTML versions of HELP files.
      These will replace the manual.html directory tree at IRIS.  A side effect
      is a slight change in appearance of the HELP files as accessed within SAC.
      Many of the pages in the "Using SAC" section had obsolete sections.  These 
      have been updated.
    * Fixed command interpolate so that calculatings of NPTS from a floating point
      number returned the nearest integer rather than the truncated integer. to do
      this, lfloat had to be added to co.h. (src/scm/xinterpolate.c, inc/co.h)
    * fixed small problem in src/bbf/readbbf.c
      
2010/05/04 Arthur Snoke <snoke@vt.edu>

    * Changed origin time in the fg seismogram from 0.0 to -43.2, station latitude,
      and put in an evdp of 0.0 (researched by GH).  (aux/seismogram)
      
2010/05/04 Arthur Snoke <snoke@vt.edu>

    * Updated src/evalresp to EVALRESP v 3.3.3 (a bug fix). 
    
2010/04/23 Arthur Snoke <snoke@vt.edu> and George Helffrich <george@gly.bris.ac.uk>

    * JAS incorporated bug fixes in SPE code that had been made by GRH in macsac.  This
      included fixing typos in inc/spe.h and small changes in five .c files in src/spe.
      The help files were updated as well (including the fact that since 1998 the 
      restriciton to 2048 points had been removed).
    * JAS found that SSS/TRAVELTIME did not work and required more time that available
      at preset to fix.  The HELP page has been rewritten to reflect this fact.  It 
      includes an alternative method using Crotwell's taup package.
      
2010/04/20 Arthur Snoke <snoke@vt.edu>

    * Fixed plotxy so that with default limits and ylog and/or xlog, limits work.
      Brian Savage had written the code in February for Y.  (src/gam/xplotxy.c)
    * Refined wording in README and the two initialization files bin/sacinit.sh.in
      and bin/sacinit.csh.in.
    * Appended the pre-IRIS/SAC history file to HISTORY so it now goes back to 1990.
      
2010/04/10 Arthur Snoke <snoke@vt.edu> and George Helffrich <george@gly.bris.ac.uk>

    * Fixed plot2 so that default X and Y limits worked correctrectly if in the 
      frequency domain.  The HELP entry has been modified.  (src/gam/xp2.c)

2010/03/23 Arthur Snoke <snoke@vt.edu>

    * Fine-tuned transfer.c so it handles frequency limits more correctly.  No noticable 
      effect based on test runs.

2010/03/15 Arthur Snoke <snoke@vt.edu>

    * Updated src/evalresp to EVALRESP v 3.3.2. 
    * Updated the TRANSFER HELP file to include documentation on the FAPfile option and
      to add more details about the FREQlimits option.  This in turn led to a small
      addition to the CUT help file.
    * Updated program SGFTOPS (source in utils) so that it can handle SGF input files
      with either byte order -- program SGFSWAP no longer needed, but is still included.

2010/01/30 Brian Savage <savage@uri.edu>

    * Updated testing framework to use command line options and not put commands into 
      the history
    * Added option to turn adding commands to the history (--history-off 
      and --history-on)
    * Converted old history to the libedit/readline history [src/history/history.c]
    * Added FAP option to transfer, along with tranfer_fap tests [ src/icm/fap.c ].
      The format of a FAP file is consistent with that produced by the program
      EVALRESP (v3.3.2), but is different from the format used by SAC2000.
    * Fixed polezero comment bug and added initial tests for transfer 

2010/01/28 Brian Savage <savage@uri.edu>

    * Setting default station (sta) and channel (Q) name off by default, 
         can be turned on by command line option

    * Applied getline patch, changed getline to getline_sac
    * Added tests for plotalpha
    * Applied patch for zmemad and unwrap, added tests for convolve and unwrap
    * Fixed bug in read/write alpha due to a missing atof() prototype

2009/05/15 Brian Savage <savage@uri.edu>
        * evalresp version 3.3.0 (Arthur Snoke: official release July 2009)
        * Removed aux/polezero directory
        * Units changed to be all nm, nm/sec, nm/sec/sec
          This is mostly a documentation fix, but used some in transfer
        * Added byte-order check in utils program sgftops (Arthur Snoke)
        * Added program sgfswap (Arthur Snoke) swaps byte-order in SGF files

2009/03/23 Brian Savage <savage@uri.edu>

        * sacswap will now swap an unevenly spaced data file

2009/02/26 Brian Savage <savage@uri.edu>
        * Added Clear memory command (alias to inicm)
        * Matlab routines update (David Yang)

2008/09/04 Version 101.2 released

2008/09/01 George Helffrich <george@gly.bris.ac.uk>
        * Modified TRANSCRIPT command (several files) to include a
	  transcript history file option that enhances the command-line
	  history feature introduced by Brian Savage on August 6. 
	  The help file aux/help/transcript has been updated to include

           at the beginning of each command in src/top/saccommands.c

2008-08-18 Brian Savage <savage@uri.edu>
        *  utils/unvis: Utility added to reclaim .sac_history files
        *  bin/sac-config: More documentation added

2008-08-11 Brian Savage <savage@uri.edu>
        *  Added Documentation directory for examples using libsac & libsacio
           Will include future updates of the Users Manual and Other 
           Documentation in various formats, including the 
           Sac Command Reference

2008-08-08 Arthur Snoke <snoke@vt.edu>
        *  Updated src/evalresp to evalresp 3.2.40 (released July 2008) 

2008-08-06 Brian Savage <savage@uri.edu>
        * Added sac history file (${HOME}/.sac_history) to save history
          from session to session

2008-07-10 Brian Savage <savage@uri.edu>
	* Bug Fix: CPU overload fixed for scripts that do not end with quit

2008-07-08 Xiaoning (David) Yang <email@redacted.org>
	* New Contributed Matlab routines to read and write sac files
	  - utils/readsac.m
	  - utils/writesac.m
	  - utils/padcat.m
	  - utils/getsacdata.m

2008-07-08 Brian Savage <savage@uri.edu>
        * Removed confusing lines in src/icm/transfer.c regarding
          uninitialized calib and calper, which are derived from
          wfdisc databases.  Final value of the scaling is printed
          at the end of the transfer routine.
          For Reference
          - calib - Conversion factor that maps digital data to 
                    value with a unit (displacement, velocity, ...)
          - calper - Period at which the calib (-ration) value is 
                     valid.
          - sac files derived from seed files and use polezero files
             and/or response file do not use the calib/calper values

2008-07-05 Brian Savage <savage@uri.edu>
	* Initial creation of the library libsac including the routines
	   - xapiir (filtering)
	   - envelope 
        * Added rsach to only read the sac header
	* Bug Fix in SUDS reading and writing system
	  Byte swapping will only occur if the host is a 
	  Big Endian system.  

2008-05-22 Brian Savage <savage@uri.edu>
        * Added readcor (Read Correlation Function) in SPE subprocess
          Currently there is no way to differentiate an actual
          Correlation function file from a regular SAC file

2008-05-13 Richard Godbee <rwg@vt.edu>
        * Fixed cnvfta() handling of very large numbers incorrectly.
          Numbers are now converted to strings correctly and sanely.

2008-04-08  Brian Savage <savage@uri.edu>
        * Fixed warnings during compilation by adding missing header files 
          and incorrectly typed parameters in function calls.  Fixed compile 
          warnings were determined from a (1) routine and (2) optimized 
          compile of the full source files.
        * Removed src/sss/xtraveltime SPARC executable file that was not
          removed years ago.
        * Transitioned build system to use inc/config.h.in and inc/config.h
          to hold the configure dependent parameters to clean up the compiler 
          output.

2008-04-01  Brian Savage  <savage@uri.edu>
        * Updated Matlab routines and now is only available if requested
          by the user upon compilation. Use the value of --enable-matlab
          with the appropriate Matlab installation directory when 
          compiling to include Matlab.  SAC needs to know where to find
          the Matlab libraries when running, use LD_LIBRARY_PATH to add
          the path to the mx and eng libraries.  OS X users may need to
          use DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH instead.  The interaction of Matlab and
          SAC is under development and in serious need to attention, 
          care and help.

2008-03-24  Brian Savage <savage@uri.edu>
        * Heavily modified the map command, New Options added
          Reworked command to use GMT 4.0 (src/fks/xgmtmap.c,
          aux/help/map)
        * changed a function that is able to determine if SAC is
          run from a script like <<EOF or is run "normally."
          (src/co/select.c)

2008-03-05  Brian Savage  <savage@uri.edu>
        * Fixed segmentation fault bug while reading files with 
          wildcards (src/dfm/readfl.c) .  

2008-03-04  Brian Savage  <savage@uri.edu>
        * Fixed bug in src/scm/xinterpolate.c.  Interpolation of very 
          long time sequences introduced unexpected phase shifts into
          resulting records.  Repeated addition changed to multiplication
          to determine the correct time position of individual samples.

2008-02-18  Brian Savage  <savage@uri.edu>
        * Fixed bug in src/bbs/getbbv.c.  An array was overrunning its
          This caused a segmentation error for the command SAC > map.

2008/02/16 Richard Godbee <rwg@vt.edu>
        * Patched src/gd3.x11/error3.c so it would not crash when
          reporting an error code reported by Xlib.

2008-02-06 Savage, Helfrich, Snoke:
        * restFP and saveFP only seem to appear on the Apple version of
          the system libraries (libgcc.a) and only for the PPC.  Tests
          found this to be a problem when building Fortran programs on
          the PPC if sac had been built with the -O2 flag.  There are
          work-arounds, but best not to build sac with -O2.  This will
          be followed for future binaries.

2007/11/20 Version 101.1 released

2007-11-19  Brian Savage  <savage@uri.edu>
        * Updated sgftox.csh to use ghostscript as the Postscript viewer
        * Readme.buildsac: Added instructions for new configure system
        * Readme: Updated Readme to handle configure 
          script and sacinit.[sh,csh]
        * Makefile.am: Added link between libsacio.a and sacio.a
        * src/dff/wsac3.c: Added, same to wsac0() but now
          updates the depmin,depmax,depmen, and the distance and azimuth.
        * libsacio.a: Changed name from sacio.a but old file still exists
          for backwards compatibility.  
        * Added routines distaz() and extrma() to handle header updates 
          for wsac3().
        * bin/sacinit.[sh,csh]: Initialization scripts for paths
          and Environment Variables
        * src/exm/xabout.c (xabout): 
        * Updated version string to incorporate the Version number
          from the configure scripts (PACKAGE_NUMBER)

2007-10-27  Brian Savage <savage@uri.edu>
        * Updated Build system to configure/autoconf

2007-10-04  Brian Savage  <savage@uri.edu>
        * SAC/src/dfm/xsort.c (xsort): 
        * SAC/src/dfm/xsort.c (reorder):        
        Fixed the sort command to operate independently of
        the SeisMgr Database routines.  This is important
        as the default is now SAC_USE_DATABASE = 0 or
        "Do not Use the SeisMgr Database"

2007-10-03  Brian Savage  <savage@uri.edu>
        * SAC/src/icm/polezero.c (polezero): 
          Bug Fix:  Characters past the end of variable key 
          were being accessed producing unanticipated results.
          Changed static length of key to dynamic and modified 
          the calls involving key: strcmp() to strncmp() with
          the inclusion of #defines for each Key Value for a
          PoleZero file.  Documentation of the Function Updated
          for doxygen.

2007-09-28  Brian Savage  <savage@uri.edu>
        * SAC/src/gd3.x11/dispatcheve3.c (dispatchevent3): 
          Added Option to restore Ultra Large Crosshairs on the PPK window
          Environment Variable: SAC_PPK_LARGE_CROSSHAIRS
             0 or Undefined - Tiny Cross Hairs
             1              - Cross Hairs of the Full Plot Window

2007-09-26  Brian Savage  <savage@uri.edu>
        * SAC/src/gam/xppk.c (xppk): 
          From Richard Godbee Through Arthur Snoke
          Make it so the ppk command does not care about the order of 
          picking the lower and upper bounds of the new time window.

        * SAC/utils/sac.h (SacHeaderName): 
          Changed first o the odelta, avoiding a conflict

2007-09-25  Brian Savage  <savage@uri.edu>
        * SAC/inc/proto.h: 
        * SAC/inc/isnan.h: 
          added include "isnan.h" header file for systems lacking isnan()
        * SAC/src/icm/polezero.c (polezero): 
          Changed isNaN() to isnan() as isNaN only operated on single 
          precision floating point numbers.  
        * free(s1) statements we2005/07/25 Version 100.1 beta removed 
	  so not to get a seg fault
          during an error message
        * SAC/src/dff/f2c.c (DEPRECATED):
          Added function to report removed functions and what to substitute 
        * SAC/src/dfm/sort.c (isNaN):
          ERROR 2118: No Transfer Function applied. In src/icm/polezero.c
          On reading of the CONSTANT Key from a Pole Zero file
          If the constant is larger than a float from a double can handle
          it barfs on the isNaN() routine in src/dfm/xsort.c
          Since the constant being read into is a double (const_)
          it should call a function with a double argument not a float
          Fix: Use isnan() (in Math Library) instead of isNaN() 
          as it handles both floats and doubles
          FIX: Replaced all occurrences of isNAN() with isnan() and
          add a statement in isNaN() about this function being deprecated.
        * SAC/src/exm/xabout.c (xabout):
          Updated exm/xabout.c

        *  src/SeisMgr/cssListOps/cssArchitecture.c 
           The filename array used for determining the architecture of the
           computer is not long enough.  The constructed filename will
           overwrite the end of the array, and cause a segmentation 
           violation.  Increased the size of the array from 31 to 64
        *  src/icm/makefile and src/SeisMgr/makefile:  In both makefiles,
           replaced "make" with ${MAKE}.  Without that, on Sun Solaris,
           trying to use "gmake" would not work for all makefiles.

2007/03/03 Version 101.0

2007/03/03 Arthur Snoke <snoke@vt.edu>
        *  Updated src/evalresp to evalresp 3.2.37 (released October 2006) 

20007/02/23 Brian Savage <savage@uri.edu>
        * Major Bug Fix for all SACIO Library routines.  Filenames and 
          string handling should be much saner now
          (added sac/dff/f2c.c - converts fortran strings to C string)
                Note this is not related to the old f2c program

                     SAC/src/dff/wsac0.c
        * Changed determination of Byte Order in CSS Files
          now done internally versus using a temporary file
        * Added a SAC_USE_DATABASE environment variable
          If set to 0, will not use the database
          If not defined, will use the database
          If set to 1, will use the database
          The database is confusing, and is buggy
          This will dramatically speed up the reading of large file lists
          ( src/ssi/sacToSeisMgr.c)
        * Added a SAC_DISPLAY_COPYRIGHT environment variable
          If defined will not show the COPYRIGHT
          The addition of this code snippet is debatable
          (src/exm/xabout.c)

2006/08/21 Brian Savage <savage13@dtm.ciw.edu>
        * Added SAC/libedit/config.h.in.  This file with the associated 
          makefile removed the dependency on issetugid() so that a build
          on solaris 2.9 would work on solaris 2.8
        * Changed SAC/libedit/makefile.  This removes the dependency 
          on issetugid() and GNU install
        * Changed SAC/src/makefile.  This removes the dependency on 
          GNU install and OS X Darwin now only  depends on 
          libncurses.5.dylib.  Previously, a build on 10.4 would not work
          on 10.3.)

2006/08/18 Arthur Snoke <snoke@vt.edu>
        *  Modified bin/sgftoeps.csh so it does not need epstool.  It still
           needs gs.  Also, changed the default scale to 0.75 so that when
           printing the .eps file it does not truncate.
        *  Added a script bin/sgf2x.csh that displays a .sgf file on the
           screen.  It uses gv.  If not available, tries /usr/bin/ggv.
           When running programs over the Internet, gv can be very slow, so
           replacing the call to gv with one to gs can be significantly faster
           This script has the functionality of the old sac program sgfplot.

2006/07/26 Richard Godbee <rwg@vt.edu>
        *  ./src/co/math.c defines fmin, fmax, and labs that are defined 
           in the Standard C library everywhere bu on the Sun. They
           have the same arguments and actions.  On OS X one gets
           warnings about possible redefinitions of these functions
           whenever one compiles a program using sacio.a on Mac OS X.
           Put in a conditional not to define them in math.c on OS X.

2006/07/17 Brian Savage <savage13@dtm.ciw.edu>
        * Bug fix: Make certain a power of 2 is greater than input number
          (src/ucf/next2.c)
        * Bug fix: Memory Leak, Old Files released on a read call
          (src/dfm/readfl.c)

2006/07/01 Arthur Snoke <snoke@vt.edu>
        *  Updated several files in aux/help taking out obsolete references.
        
2006/05/31 Arthur Snoke <snoke@vt.edu>
        * added a rm \tmp/sactemp.ps commend in src/gam/xprint.c to erase
          that file after printing so if subsequent user does a p1 print
          there Will not be an existing file with a different owner in /tmp.

2006/05/18 Brian Savage <savage13@dtm.ciw.edu>
        * Added utility program saclst (modified from program by Lupei Zhu).
          Standalone program allows display of header variables that can
          be ported to programs or printed.  Source is in ./utils and is put
          in ./bin during a normal build.

2006/05/04 Brian Savage <savage13@dtm.ciw.edu>
        * Modified the number of Y Limit points to match the 
          maximum number of files
          (inc/gam.h)
        * Added -p flag to install to preserve modification dates
          (src/makefile)

2006/05/02 Richard Godbee <rwg@vt.edu>
        * Edited src/co/math.c so that if fmin & fmax are defined elssewhere
          on the system, they won't be defined again (a warning message)
          Arthur Snoke <snoke@vt.edu>
        * Edited src/makefile so that SAC/utils and SAC/bin/sacswap 
          get copied to PREFIX/sac

2006/03/27 Richard Godbee <rwg@vt.edu>
        * Changed all occurrences of gets() to fgets()and corrected
          boundingbox in sgftops.c (utils/sgftops.c)
        
2006/03/02 Brian Savage <savage13@dtm.ciw.edu>
        * Added utils/sacswap.c and changed Makefile to create it

2006/02/14 Brian Savage <savage13@dtm.ciw.edu>
        * Fixed writehdr bug for files of opposite endian
          (src/dff/wrsac.c)
        * Changed call to map_hdr_out() to allow for swapping
          (src/dff/map_hdr_out.c)
        * Fixed bug in zwabs() with bad prototype
          (src/co/zwabs.c)

2005/12/13 George Helffrich http://www1.gly.bris.ac.uk/~george/gh.html
        * Tweak makefile (again) so builds work on any MacOS system
          (src/makefile)

2005/12/01 George Helffrich http://www1.gly.bris.ac.uk/~george/gh.html
        * Tweak makefile so MacOS 10.2.x builds work
          (src/makefile)
        * Update Readme info to mention 10.2.x builds work
          (Readme.buildsac)

2005/11/30 George Helffrich http://www1.gly.bris.ac.uk/~george/gh.html
        * Eliminate warning messages about redefined #defines by shrouding
          them in #ifdef conditionals.
          (inc/proto.h)

2005/07/25 Version 100.1 beta released

2005/07/22 Richard Godbee <rwg@vt.edu>
        * In Apple OS 10.4.2 with xcode 2.1, swab() is defined twice: 
          in string.h and unistd.h.  As string.h is not needed,
          remove unneeded #include <string.h> from exm/xcd.c.
        * In order to get a successful build using gcc 4.0 in OS 10.4.2,
          found it necessary to move the prototype for e_decompress() 
          above the enlarge() function in SeisMgr/cssListOps/enlarge.c.
          
2005/07/21 Brian Savage <savage13@dtm.ciw.edu>
        * Fixed bug in help command for non-existent commands
          (ucf/wrhelp.c)
        * Fixed pause/redraw bug 
          (co/zgtmsg.c)
        * Added co/select.c to remove duplicate code in co/zgpmsg.c
          and co/zgtmsg.c.  To set a prompt and get a message use
          select_loop() and its axillary functions.
        * Modified co/zsleep.c to be platform independent
          now uses select_loop with a timeout to handle sleeping

2005/05/26 Brian Savage <savage13@dtm.ciw.edu>
        * Fully integrated libedit into build process
        * Updated Readme, License, History, Readme.buildsac files
        * Removed extra CC=cc lines in makefile
        * Updated Makefile for better install process

2005/05/23 Brian Savage <savage13@dtm.ciw.edu>
        * Changed from GNU Readline to editline due to License conflicts
           between GNU Public License and the SAC License
        * Changed function name parse_line to parse_line_evresp
           It conflicts with a function call in the libedit library
          (evalresp/evresp.c)
          (evalresp/string_fctns.c)
        * Fix Bug for X Error Handling and Editline
          (gd3.x11/createwindo3.c)
          (gd3.x11/error3.c) - Added
        * Added History file for Version history
        * Added License file for the SAC License
        * Cleaned up Changes file, includes all the intermediate changes
        
2005/04/18 Brian Savage <savage13@dtm.ciw.edu>
        * Fix Bug during window resize, now frees and recreates backing pixmap
          (gd3.x11/dispatcheve3.c)
        * Changed bounding box back to letter (792 612)
          (utils/sgftops.c)

2005/03/11 Brian Savage <savage13@dtm.ciw.edu>
        * Fix Bug during select() for an Interrupted System Call
          (co/gpmsg.c)
        
2005/02/20 Brian Savage <savage13@dtm.ciw.edu>
        * USE_X11_DOUBLE_BUFFER was part of the ANNOYANCE_FIXES patch
	   Moved the position of where the XExposeEvent is emitted from the
	   end of the command loop to endframe->endframe3->flushbuffer so now
	   only  routines that draw to the screen get an XExposeEvent.  
           Many of the files
           are changing the #ifdef Statements from ANNOYANCE_FIXES to

        * USE_X11_MULTIPLE_DEPTHS allows use of XCreateImage and XPutImage
           on displays of various depths.  We need to know what the pixel 
           size when creating an XImage, which depends on the depth of 
           the window and display.

2005/02/23 Peter Goldstein <peterg@llnl.gov>
        * Updated sgf plotting utilities to with enhanced versions from 
           Arthur Snoke.  New version of sgftops does translation rotation 
           and scaling  of postscript plots. sgftoeps.csh is a csh shell 
           script that creates encapsulated postscript  that are compatible 
           with latex and version 10 of Adobe Illustrator. The script 
           requires epstool (http://www.ghostgum.com.au/) and ghostscript 
           (http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~ghost/).

2005/02/07 Brian Savage <savage13@dtm.ciw.edu>
 
        * Added export to SACFLAGS to push -D$(OSTYPE) into subdirectories
        * Added OSTYPE=linux for linux systems defined as linux-gnu
        * Command Line editing added to main/sac.c
           Uses the GNU Readline Library
           Set ANNOYANCE_FIXES=TRUE in makefile to get command line editing
        * Updated X11 events for window redraws (gd3.x11)
           We now draw to a pixmap when ploting and this is then drawn to the 
           screen. When one window overlaps the plotting window, the pixmap 
           is drawn to the screen
           Set ANNOYANCE_FIXES=TRUE in makefile to get X11 Fixes
        * Added a select() call to switch between X Events and Keyboard Events
        * Modified csserror.c to not use sys_errlist and sys_nerr, they output
           warnings upon linking/compilation

2004/12/08 Peter Goldstein <peterg@llnl.gov>
        * Version 100.00 released for Solaris, Linux, and OS X
        * Recent enhancements and bug fixes: 
        * Automatic byteswapping has been implemented.  SAC will automatically
           read sac data files in either big or little endian format. (ie., It
           doesn't matter if your data were created on a little endian 
           platform like i686-based PCs or big endian platforms like 
           Sun workstations.   
        * readalpha/readtable (command for reading ascii tables or columns of
           xy data): a bug in the linux version has been fixed.
