## Introduction

The Earthquake Seismology Repository aims to centralize useful scripts and programs that facilitate various tasks in seismology. Whether you're analyzing seismic data, generating visualizations, or automating workflows, this repository offers tools to support your work.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into the following directories and files:

- `data_processing/` - Scripts for processing raw seismic data.
- `visualization/` - Tools for creating visual representations of seismic events.
- `analysis/` - Programs for statistical and qualitative analysis of seismic data.
- `utilities/` - Miscellaneous helper scripts and utilities.
- `GitHub Cheat Sheet` - A guide for using GitHub under Ubuntu command line.

*Note: The above structure is based on standard practices. Please adjust the directory names and descriptions to match the actual contents of your repository.*

## Branches
